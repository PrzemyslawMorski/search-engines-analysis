Iraq until recently had refused to take them back, but struck a deal with the United States in March to repatriate its citizens, sparking the immigration sweeps. \nThe Iraqis and civil rights groups representing them sued the federal government. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith, in Detroit, had previously halted the deportation of the Iraqis, many of whom are Christian, who argued they would face persecution if they were sent back to Iraq. \nIn his ruling on Tuesday, Goldsmith said that any of the Iraqis held for six months or longer must either be released or granted a bond hearing before an immigration judge within 30 days. \n“Our legal tradition rejects warehousing human beings while their legal rights are being determined,” wrote Goldsmith. \nThe Trump administration has tried to deport the Iraqis as part of its push to increase immigration enforcement and make countries, which have resisted in the past, take back nationals ordered deported from the United States. FILE PHOTO: Protesters rally outside the federal court just before a hearing to consider a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Iraqi nationals facing deportation, in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., June 21, 2017. REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/File Photo \nSince June, immigration enforcement officers have detained approximately 300 Iraqi nationals with final deportation orders, according to information provided to the court by the Iraqis’ lawyers. There are approximately 1,400 Iraqis in the United States with final deportation orders. \nThe U.S. government said in March that Iraq had agreed to repatriate Iraqi nationals ordered deported from the United States. \nBut Goldsmith noted in his order that the United States has “no written agreement” with Iraq regarding its cooperation, and that it is therefore unclear whether Iraq had agreed to take back all its nationals, and if so, under what conditions. \nGoldsmith said his ruling would apply to Iraqi detainees in similar circumstances nationwide, even if they are not involved in the litigation. \n“(Goldsmith) just really reaffirmed the principle that indefinite detention in this country is not acceptable,” said Kary Moss, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, which is representing the Iraqis. \nThe Department of Justice, which is arguing on behalf of the government, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

But amid a glut of natural gas , Cramer said oil and gas companies with natural gas exposure become riskier investments.\nPure natural gas picks with holdings in the Pennsylvanian Marcellus shale or the Ohioan Utica shale like EQT or Chesapeake Energy , respectively, are even riskier, Cramer said.\n\"If the weather stays like this for a couple more days and the natural gas stocks still don't participate and natural gas doesn't fly through the roof, I say trim, trim, trim,\" he advised. \"The surfeit may be so large that even this cold snap isn't enough to move the needle.\"\nFor drilling and service companies like Halliburton , the risk is not so much a glut as it is the potential effects of technological advances on the sector, Cramer said.\nThe \"Mad Money\" host questioned how much service will be needed given the improvements to drilling tech, even in notoriously oil-flush Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico.\nNormally, Cramer would expect a bump in Baker Hughes ' stock, but the rig-counting oilfield service company's ties to the bedraggled General Electric are likely stifling buyers, he said.\n\"[Baker Hughes] might be the first thing GE sells in order to shore up its balance sheet,\" Cramer said. \"It will most likely be the subject of a fire sale. I think it should be broken up and sold to pieces, but it doesn't matter. I say no, thank you.\"\nInvestors should be particularly selective when it comes to the energy giants, most of which no longer trade together, Cramer advised.\nCramer said he would be a buyer of Schlumberger , the world's biggest oilfield service company, and noted that Chevron has been anointed a growth stock by Wall Street and BP has been dubbed a safe stock. Above all, Cramer asked investors not to go \"ETF hunting.\"\n\"It's not worth buying the bad with the good\" in the energy sector, he said.\nIndependent energy plays were more straightforward. Cramer said any companies with exposure to Permian oil growth like Cimarex , Diamondback Energy or Concho would work.\nBut when it comes to the best of the best with crude topping $60 a barrel, Cramer suggested the pipeline stocks for three reasons.\n\"The group is well below where it was trading when oil was last at these prices,\" he said. \"The pipeline companies are no longer struggling with the U.S. government; [the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] greenlights pretty much anything. The independents are desperate for new pipe to take natural gas out of Marcellus and Utica to the South and the Northeast, and to take oil and gas out of the Permian for export.\"\nThe \"Mad Money\" host was sanguine on most of the pipeline plays, particularly those tied to well-run companies like Magellan Midstream Partners or Enterprise Product Partners .\nThe one thing Cramer didn't want homegamers to overthink was the effect of the new tax law on their energy investments, because the group trades more on asset growth than on tax-adjusted earnings.\n\"There you have it, your game plan for this suddenly revitalized sector, brought back to life by $60 oil, a welcome level for the entire group,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"Just remember, a rising tide is no reason to stop being selective. Stick with Schlumberger, Chevron, BP, the independents with Permian exposure — Cimarex, Diamondback, Concho — and the best run pipelines: Magellan Midstream and Enterprise Product Partners.\"\nWATCH: Cramer revises his outlook on oil stocks show chapters Cramer shares his top energy stock picks as oil prices rise      20 Hours Ago | 04:56 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Schlumberger, Cimarex and Magellan Midstream Partners. \nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

Given the bullish growth outlook, economists expect the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in March after increasing borrowing costs three times last year. \n“Strong manufacturing and construction data confirm the U.S. economy is firing on all cylinders at the turn of the year,” said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. “The Fed remains solidly on track to lift rates again in March and two more times this year, with possible upside risk if growth doesn’t simmer down.” \nThe Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity jumped to a reading of 59.7 last month, the second-highest reading in six years, from 58.2 in November. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. \nThe survey’s new orders sub-index shot up 5.4 points to 69.4, the highest reading since January 2004. Manufacturers also reported an increase in export orders. While a measure of factory employment fell 2.7 points last months it remained at lofty levels consistent with an expansion in manufacturing payrolls. \nFactories also reported paying more for raw materials, with the survey’s prices index jumping by 3.5 points. Rising raw material prices bolster the view that inflation will pick up in 2018. \nManufacturing is likely to get a boost this year from a $1.5 trillion tax cut approved by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress last month. The overhaul of the tax code, the most sweeping in 30 years, slashed the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. \nBusiness spending surged in anticipation of the corporate tax cuts. Recent weakness in the dollar and a strengthening global economy are expected to buoy exports of U.S.-made goods, which would underpin manufacturing. \n“It is more than just domestic developments that are lifting animal spirits,” said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. “A number of the published industry comments focused on a pick-up in demand from overseas.” \nThe dollar .DXY was trading higher against a basket of currencies. U.S. stock indexes hit record highs and prices of U.S. Treasuries rose. BULLISH OUTLOOK \nThe ISM survey showed manufacturers upbeat about the economic outlook. Machinery producers reported strong international sales and computer and electronic products manufacturers said they were “seeing a ramp-up with companies releasing early 2018 spend now.” \nFood, beverage and tobacco products manufacturers, however, struck a more cautious note saying that while the economy and business were strong, signals of “headwinds in 2018 are persistent.” \nIn a separate report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose 0.8 percent to an all-time high of $1.257 trillion in November. It advanced 2.4 percent on a year-on-year basis. \nThe manufacturing and construction reports added to data ranging from the labor market to housing and consumer spending in sketching a robust picture of the U.S. economy. \nFollowing Wednesday’s data, the Atlanta Fed raised its fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimate by four-tenths of a percentage point to an annualized rate of 3.2 percent. The economy grew at a 3.2 percent pace in the third quarter. \nIn November, spending on private residential projects soared 1.0 percent to the highest level since February 2007 after rising 0.3 percent in October. The increase was in line with a recent jump in homebuilding and supported expectations that housing would boost economic growth in the fourth quarter after being a drag on GDP since the April-June period. \nSpending on nonresidential structures rebounded 0.9 percent in November after falling 0.2 percent in the prior month. Overall, spending on private construction projects climbed 1.0 percent in November to a record high. That followed a 0.3 percent increase in October. \nOutlays on public construction projects rose 0.2 percent in November after jumping 3.5 percent in October. Economists, however, expect modest gains in public spending in the months ahead. \n“Many state budgets are being squeezed by weaker-than-expected revenues, and face other budgetary pressures related to things like health care,” said Nancy Vanden Houten, a senior economist at Oxford Economics in New York. “Also, the impact of the new tax law on state and local budgets is not yet clear.” Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T17:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T18:08:25.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

China's Caixin index of Chinese industry rose to a four-month high of 51.5 in December, confounding forecasts for a decline. The reading pointed to resilience for the world's largest consumer of commodities even as Beijing cracks down on industrial pollution and engineers a cooling property market. \nIt also bolstered expectations of global economic strength for the first month of the year amid strong readings on manufacturing in the euro zone. Currencies from Brazil, Mexico, Chile , Colombia strengthened between 0.9 percent and 1.7 percent. Stock indexes were up throughout the region, with Brazil's benchmark Bovespa leading gains as traders unwound bets on a credit downgrade. Brazilian policymakers met in December with rating agencies to stave off a downgrade after lawmakers delayed a key vote on a plan to streamline the social security system and curb government spending. \"The market sought protection from what looked like an imminent sovereign downgrade, but that did not materialize,\" H.Commcor brokerage trader Cleber Alessie said. Metalúrgica Gerdau SA stock was the biggest gainer on the benchmark index after Commercial Metals Co agreed to acquire certain U.S. rebar assets owned by the Brazilian steelmaker. \nKey Latin American stock indexes and currencies at 1720 GMT: \nStock indexes daily % YTD % \nchange change Latest \nMSCI Emerging Markets 1175.55 1.56 -0.08 MSCI LatAm 2894.09 2.33 0 Brazil Bovespa 77653.30 1.64 1.64 Mexico S&P/BVM IPC 49622.44 0.54 0.54 Chile IPSA 5592.51 0.5 0.50 Chile IGPA 28111.30 0.47 0.47 Argentina MerVal 30475.44 1.36 1.36 Colombia IGBC 11421.38 -0.49 0.45 Venezuela IBC 1265.15 0.16 -96.01 Currencies daily % YTD % \nchange change \nLatest \nBrazil real 3.2641 1.51 -0.46 Mexico peso 19.5250 0.89 6.24 Chile peso 607.8 1.13 10.35 Colombia peso 2933.84 1.64 2.31 Argentina peso (interbank) 18.5800 0.38 -14.56 Argentina peso (parallel) 19.15 0.68 -12.17 \n(Reporting by Bruno Federowski in Sao Paulo; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-02T18:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-02T21:23:57.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images A ground operations employee loads baggage onto a Southwest Airlines plane at John Wayne Airport in Santa Ana, California. \nSouthwest Airlines is upsizing. \nThe airline has exercised options for 40 Boeing 737 Max 8 airplanes worth $4.5 billion at list prices, it said late Tuesday. Southwest is also deferring orders for smaller models to at least 2023. \nThe carrier, like other airlines around the world, has been mulling which aircraft to add to its fleet as record numbers of passengers take to the skies. \nIf airlines choose planes that are too big, they risk owning multimillion-dollar behemoths that are expensive to fly and tough to fill with passengers . If they go too small, their costs per seat could be high and they may need more aircraft to meet demand. \nCompared with other airlines whose fleets include planes from different manufacturers, Southwest only flies Boeing 737s, and the carrier is the biggest operator of the Chicago-based company's narrow-body jets. \nThe change in Southwest's order does not change its plan for capacity growth this year, it said. \nThe Boeing 737 Max 8 fits as many as 189 seats, according to Boeing, but Southwest intends to fly them with 175 on board. \nSouthwest debuted the 737 Max 8 last year in the 175-seat configuration, with 32 inches of legroom. The airline intends to fly the smaller Max 7 with 143 passengers. \nThe airline announced the fleet changes in a statement applauding the passage of the tax law late last year, which it said allows it to give its workers $1,000 bonuses . \nSouthwest will get 15 of the 737 Max 8s next year and 25 in 2020, it said. Twenty-three of the smaller 737 Max 7s will be delivered in 2023 and 11 others in 2024, according to the airline. \nThe airline said the delay in accepting the smaller 737 Max 7 jets would allow it to line it up with the retirement of some older 737 planes. \n\"They both still fit in with our fleet plan,\" spokesman Chris Mainz said of the two new 737 models. \nFor its part, Boeing said that \"there is no impact to the Max program\" as a result of Southwest's decision.

U.S.-traded shares were unchanged at $10.70. \nAnalysts at Brazilian bank BTG Pactual said the market had expected a settlement of $5 billion to $10 billion. Moody's said in a note that if approved the fine \"would remove the uncertainty related to the amount to be paid to plaintiffs.\" \nThe plaintiffs were upbeat, too. \n\"Simply put, this litigation and its ultimate resolution has yielded an excellent result for the class,\" said Jeremy Lieberman, an attorney for the investors. He called the deal \"historic\" and said it was the largest ever involving a foreign securities issuer. \nInvestors had sued Petrobras after prosecutors in Brazil accused executives of accepting more than $2 billion in bribes over a decade, mainly from construction and engineering companies. \nPetrobras claimed it was itself a victim and denied wrongdoing in a securities filing on Wednesday. But its market value has plunged as its central role in a massive corruption scheme continues to be unwound by investigators. \nFor the past four years, Brazil has been rocked by the so-called \"Car Wash\" investigation, which has exposed billions of dollars in kickbacks to executives of state-run companies and politicians who appointed them to their jobs. \nPetrobras said it hoped the settlement would resolve all investor claims in the United States. \nThe deal does not include investors who bought non U.S.-based Petrobras securities outside the United States, according to the company. \nThe deal came days after Brazil's securities regulator CVM formally accused eight former Petrobras executives of corruption. \nThe accusations relate to possible irregularities in the contracting process for three drilling ships, according to a legal filing by the regulator last Friday. \nAmong the accused in CVM's filing are former Petrobras Chief Executives Officers Maria das Gracas Foster and Jose Sergio Gabrielli.

Aaron in for Adam this morning.\nFor years, some iPhone owners have contended that Apple software updates purposely slowed their phones after two years in order to entice them to upgrade. The ghost of Steve Jobs forcing some planned obsolesce on customers , perhaps? You may have missed it over the holidays, but Apple actually admitted to purposely slowing older iPhones. So the conspiracy theorists are vindicated, right? Not exactly.\nWhat Apple was up to over its past few iOS updates was not trying to entice new phone buying, but rather to solve a different conspiracy-theory-sparking iPhone bug. That was the glitch where an iPhone suddenly shut down even though the battery reported it had a remaining charge of 30%, 40%, sometimes even more than 50%. Why would an iPhone with half its charge left suddenly shut down?\nNow all is revealed. It turns out that as phone batteries age, not only do they hold less charge, they also lose the ability to output maximum voltage at one time. So when an iPhone with an older battery needed a lot of power all at once, the battery couldn’t keep up and the phone shut down. To avoid these seemingly random shutdowns, Apple tweaked iOS to cap the power draw, in effect forcing the phone to slow down. A better solution, or co-solution, might have been to alert iPhone owners that their batteries needed to be replaced.\nThat’s the new approach. So if you’re still rocking an iPhone 6 or 6S, and maybe even soon an iPhone 7, it’s probably time to get that battery replaced. And for only $29 , your iPhone will be back to full speed.\nAaron Pressman @ampressman aaron.pressman@fortune.com NEWSWORTHY Year end markdowns . Just before year end, Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son completed his deal to buy a big stake in Uber at a discount. Son's SoftBank Group will buy out some current shareholders for $6.5 billion to acquire a 15% stake, a 30% discount from Uber's last private valuation. SoftBank will also invest another $1.25 billion for new preferred shares from Uber at the prior valuation of about $68 billion.\nCouch surfing to the max . More than 3 million people stayed in an Airbnb rental over New Year's, company CEO Brian Chesky revealed , up from 2 million last year and just 1,400 in 2009.\n'Til daddy takes her T-bird away. Researchers at Stanford University analyzed 50 million images from Google's Street View app and matched any vehicles pictured with demographic data about the locations. In addition to creating some new trivia question answers (i.e. the city showing cars with the best average gas mileage is Burlington, Vt.), the researchers were able to make a model that could predict income, race, education, and voting patterns.\nKeyless failure . Not all the hot startups of 2017 lasted into 2018. Smart lock maker Otto suspended operations after running out of cash and probably will never deliver its cute $700 phone-controlled door lock.\nSpeedy delivery. President Trump took on one of his favorite tech targets, Amazon.com , in a tweet last week. \"Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer?\" Trump asked .\nUps and downs. Chinese smartphone maker Huawei had good news and bad news over the holidays. It finally cracked the U.S. market with a deal to sell its new Mate 10 flagship via AT&T. But its head of sales in China was detained as part of a bribery investigation.\nFOOD FOR THOUGHT Digital currencies remain all the rage. Bitcoin may have started the year off with a stumble, but the alternative known as Ripple or XRP jumped 56% on Friday to hit a total market value of $86 billion, surpassing Ethereum for second place in the cryptocurrency universe. Venture capitalist Fred Wilson notes that crypto startups raised $3.7 billion last year, but he doesn't think most will succeed. A veteran of the original Internet bubble, Wilson sees some parallels:\nTransaction clearing times on public, open, scaled blockchains (BTC and ETH, for example) remind me of the 14.4 dialup period of the Internet. You can get a taste of what things will be like, but you can't really use the technology yet. It just doesn't work at scale. But it will and the money that is getting invested via the frenzy we are in is going to make that happen.\nThis is the biggest story in tech in 2017 because transitions from Internet 1.0 to Internet 2.0 to Internet 3.0 cause tremendous opportunity and tremendous disruption. Not all of the big companies of the dialup phase (Yahoo, AOL, Amazon, eBay) made a healthy transition into the mobile/broadband phase. And not all of the big companies of the broadband/mobile phase (Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon) will make a healthy transition into the decentralized phase. Some will, some won't.\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT The Italian Clothing Brand Steve Jobs Has Nothing to Do With Apple's Steve Jobs.

That is only stored in users’ mobiles, computers and other terminals,” WeChat said in a post on the social media platform. \n“WeChat will not use any content from user chats for big data analysis. Because of WeChat’s technical model that does not store or analyze user chats, the rumor that ‘we are watching your WeChat everyday’ is pure misunderstanding.” \nLi Shufu, chairman of Geely Holdings, owner of the Volvo car brand, was quoted in Chinese media on Monday as saying Tencent Chairman Ma Huateng “must be watching all our WeChats every day”. \nLike all Chinese social media platforms, WeChat is required to censor public posts deemed “illegal” by the Communist Party. WeChat’s privacy policy says it may need to retain and disclose users’ information “in response to a request by a government authority, law enforcement agency or similar body”. \nWeChat did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. \nAccording to a report by Amnesty International, Tencent ranked at the bottom of 11 tech firms running the world’s most popular messenger apps for how they use encryption to protect user privacy. \nChina’s cyber watchdog in September announced a new rule making chat group administrators and companies accountable for breaches of content rules. \nIn the same month it handed down maximum penalties to tech firms including Tencent, Baidu Inc and Weibo Corp for failing to properly censor online content, and asked them to increase content auditing measures.

For the first time ever, the index did not have a single losing month in all of 2017, perhaps even more impressive than its nearly 20 percent annual gain.\n\"With so much momentum coming into this year, Lang thinks it would be a big mistake to get too bearish on this one,\" Cramer said.\nIn the fourth quarter, more stocks in the S&P started to trade above their 50-day moving averages, a good indicator of the breadth and strength of the index's rally.\nCramer attributed the strength to institutional buying after the S&P's small dip in November, and said that the strategy was a winning one going forward as well.\n\"Until we see any evidence that these institutions want to start selling en masse, and we have none, Lang thinks you should keep buying the S&P into any dip if we get one,\" Cramer advised. \"Last year, the S&P only had two pullbacks, and they both went to its 20-week moving average ... and both [of] these turned out to be excellent buying opportunities.\"\nAll in all, Lang wouldn't be surprised if the S&P logged yet another double-digit gain in the new year, he told Cramer.\nWhat of the Dow industrials? First and foremost, Cramer noted the average's 25 percent gain for 2017, calling its weekly chart \"picture-perfect.\"\nFrom the Chaikin money flow oscillator, which measures buying and selling pressure, to the Relative Strength Index, which measures momentum, the Dow's technical indicators were red-hot for most of 2017, indicating high levels of institutional buying.\n\"From a momentum perspective, Lang says this chart is a thing of beauty,\" Cramer said. \"Volume trends are positive, the money flow remains very strong — what's not to like?\"\nLang even said that trying to call a top for the Dow would be \"pointless\" given its strength and predicted a 12 to 15 percent rise in 2018, keeping the possibility of Dow 30,000 on the table.\n\"[These] charts give us a lot of reasons to be feeling pretty darned good about 2018,\" Cramer said. \"No, we don't want to get too euphoric. No, we don't want to be complacent. But I also think it's a big mistake to get too cynical — that's right, too sardonic — for your own good. Irony never made a dime for anybody.

Vice puts two top execs on leave, tech bros are throwing regular sex parties, and a record number of women are expected to run for governor this year. Have a productive Wednesday. EVERYONE'S TALKING \n• The time is now . My colleague Claire Zillman takes a closer look at Time’s Up, the action plan for tacking sexual harassment launched this week by Hollywood A-listers including Reese Witherspoon, Shonda Rhimes, and Eva Longoria. \nWhat’s unique about the initiative, writes Claire, is that despite the boldface names attached, its legal defense fund will help women who are largely without power or prominence. (For a sense of what women in blue-collar jobs too often experience, please check out this NYT story from last week.) Time’s Up “comes at a time when initiatives aimed at bettering the working lives of women have not only lacked universality, but have effectively siloed women into two classes, haves and have-nots, ” she notes. \nThat split can be seen in everything from the concerns raised at last January’s Women’s March to the generous leave policies that apply only to certain employees to the celebrity-driven aspect of the #MeToo movement. There’s no denying that the fight for gender equity too often leaves out women who are not white and middle- or upper-class. So it’s gratifying to see some of Hollywood’s biggest names not only call attention to the plight of their less glamorous sisters, but to actually use their wealth to help them make change. Let’s hope this is a sign of things to come in 2018. Fortune ALSO IN THE HEADLINES \n• Tip jar . The New Yorker’s Dana Goodyear looks at the ways Hollywood is responding to the post-Weinstein/#MeToo world. She describes an industry where—almost overnight—everything has changed so dramatically that no one is quite sure what comes next. (One thing they do know: “No one wants to get caught on the wrong side of history.”) Interestingly, the story also notes that the Hollywood Reporter has created a sexual-misconduct beat and “assigned seven reporters, who are fielding ten to fifteen tips a day.” A related and important reminder to all you Broadsheet readers: My inbox is always open for any tips related to sexual harassment—and anything that comes in via the “send tip” button at the top of this newsletter remains anonymous.

(Trump) is saying the time has come to stop saying flattering words (to the Palestinians).\"\nBut Tzipi Livni, an Israeli opposition politician and a former peace negotiator, said \"a responsible and serious (Israeli) government\" should quietly tell Trump that it would be in Israel's interest to prevent a \"humanitarian crisis in Gaza\" and to continue to fund Palestinian security forces cooperating with Israel.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Trump's U.N. ambassador disclosed plans to stop funding a United Nations agency that provides humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees.\n\"The president has basically said he doesn't want to give any additional funding, or stop funding, until the Palestinians agree to come back to the negotiation table,\" Ambassador Nikki Haley told reporters when asked about future U.S. funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA)for Palestinian refugees.\nIn an emailed statement, UNRWA spokesman Chris Gunness said: \"UNRWA has not been informed by the United States administration of any changes in U.S. funding to the Agency.\"\nThe United States is the largest donor to the agency, with a pledge of nearly $370 million as of 2016, according to UNRWA's website.\nAccording to UNRWA's website, there are 5.9 million UNRWA refugees and other registered persons eligible for its services, which include education and health care, in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T13:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T13:21:11.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Cowen and Co. analyst Oliver Chen is calling the company his \"best idea for 2018,\" based on the fact that customers still appreciate TJX's \"deep value.\"\n\"As most of traditional retail contracts their store bases and right-sizes their organizations to better fit the new normal of lower revenue bases, TJX sees significant white space ahead in terms of store growth,\" Chen wrote.\nGrowing at such a rapid clip (and recently launching a new brand, Homesense) could be a smart move for TJX, where others are cutting back, but some remain wary the expansion could come back to haunt the company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T18:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T18:25:13.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

That has added to expectations that the European Central Bank, which this month will halve its monthly bond purchases, will shutter the program later this year. \n“The euro zone manufacturing boom gained further momentum in December, rounding off the best year on record and setting the scene for a strong start to 2018,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the surveys. \nThe December euro zone final manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) was 60.6, matching an earlier preliminary reading, the highest since the survey began in June 1997. Any figure above 50 represents growth. \nThe euro rose to a three-month high above $1.20. \nThe factory output index, which feeds into a broader set of data including services due on Thursday, rose to 62.2 from 61.0 in November. That was its highest in over 17 years and a reading exceeded only once in the survey’s more than two decades of history. \nGermany and France, the euro zone’s two largest economies look to be expanding in tandem, striking their highest manufacturing PMI numbers on record and for 17 years, respectively. But growth slowed in Italy, the bloc’s third largest economy. \nIn Britain, which is in the process of negotiating a withdrawal from the European Union, growth tailed off sharply from a four-year high the previous month. \n“Strong growth will be hard to sustain in 2018,” noted Samuel Tombs, UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. He pointed out that the UK PMI had underperformed the euro zone’s by the most since June 2008. \n“British manufacturers ... are failing to make the most of the rebound in global trade,” Tombs wrote. UNEVEN PERFORMANCE IN ASIA \nFactory activity hit a five-year high in India and the best in 6-1/2 years in Taiwan, and also picked up in China. But activity contracted in South Korea, Malaysia and Indonesia, a sign that regional interest rate hikes are likely to be gradual. \n“Robust external demand and accommodative domestic monetary policy should help keep Asian manufacturing sectors in good shape,” said Krystal Tan, Asia economist at Capital Economics. \nIn China, manufacturing growth unexpectedly picked up to a four-month high in December amid a surge in new orders, suggesting continued strength in global trade. \nThe Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 51.5 from 50.8 in November, and far outpaced expectations in a Reuters poll for a dip to 50.6. \nThe China PMI, which pushed Asian shares .MIAPJ0000PUS to their highest in a decade, was somewhat at odds with a much larger official China PMI survey on Sunday. It showed a slowdown in growth amid a crackdown on pollution and measures to curb risky financing and cool the housing market. \nThe difference, analysts say, stems from the fact that the Caixin/PMI index tracks smaller, private firms, more sensitive to exports. \nChina is expected to have grown by close to 7 percent in 2017, but the world’s second largest economy is likely to slow in the new year on the back of those measures, highlighted as policy priorities at October’s key Communist Party congress. \nBeijing is expected to target 2018 growth of around 6.5 percent. \n“We believe a moderate growth slowdown to be more visible in the first half of 2018, especially on the investment front, due mainly to the tight financial conditions and a cool down of the property market,” BofA Merrill Lynch economists said. \nChina’s slowdown means that for the rest of Asia, the pace of rate increases is unlikely to match that of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is likely to raise interest rates three times this year, and possibly more. \nThere will likely be “only a few rate hikes here and there across the region over the coming two years,” HSBC analysts wrote in a note, even as they expect Asian economies to keep chugging along in 2018, led by tech and trade. \nIndia’s PMI showed factory activity expanding at the fastest pace in five years, buoyed by a rise in output and new orders, which allowed firms to raise prices. The data firmed up views that interest rates in Asia’s third-largest economy have probably bottomed. \nPMIs for Japan, which surpassed growth expectations in 2017 on the back of the surging tech and trade cycle globally, will be released on Thursday. \nThe U.S. manufacturing PMI is due later on Tuesday.

They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel ... with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?” \nThe President’s tweets follow plans disclosed by his U.N. ambassador earlier on Tuesday to stop funding a United Nations agency that provides humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees. \n“The President has basically said he doesn’t want to give any additional funding, or stop funding, until the Palestinians agree to come back to the negotiation table,” Ambassador Nikki Haley told reporters when asked about future U.S. funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees. \nThe U.S. is the largest donor to the agency, with a pledge of nearly $370 million as of 2016, according to UNRWA’s website. Undercover Israeli security personnel detain a Palestinian demonstrator during clashes at a protest against U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, near the Jewish settlement of Beit El, near the West Bank city of Ramallah December 13, 2017. REUTERS/Mohamad Torokman \nRelations between the Palestinians and Washington soured early last month after Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, generating outrage across the Arab world and concern among Washington’s Western allies. \nWeeks later, more than 120 countries defied Trump and voted in favor of a U.N. General Assembly resolution calling for the United States to drop its stance on Jerusalem’s status. \n“What we saw with the resolution was not helpful to the situation,” Haley said on Tuesday. \n“The Palestinians now have to show to the world that they want to come to the table. As of now, they’re not coming to the table but they asked for aid. We’re not giving the aid, we’re going to make sure that they come to the table and we want to move forward with the peace process,” she said. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called the Trump administration’s decision on Jerusalem the “greatest crime” and a flagrant violation of international law, and said it was unacceptable for the United States to have a role in the Middle East peace process because it was biased in favor of Israel. \nOn Tuesday, the Israeli Parliament passed an amendment that would make it harder for it to cede control over parts of Jerusalem in any peace deal with the Palestinians.

Political insiders have privately questioned Buhari’s willingness, or ability, to keep the top job after he spent much of the past year in Britain being treated for an undisclosed ailment that left him visibly weakened. \nBut Adebayo Shittu, Nigeria’s minister of communications who played a prominent role in Buhari’s 2015 campaign, said he would chair a group to support the re-election of the president and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. \nCampaigning for the re-election of a president in Nigeria has often started with such support groups before the incumbent declares his intention to run again. \n“We, his ardent supporters who appreciate his worth on behalf of millions of Nigerians, would urge him to recontest,” Shittu told reporters in the capital Abuja after informing Buhari of his plans to head the group. \n“I know he has not made up his mind but I can say that some of us can assist him in making up his mind,” he added. \nThe fact that Shittu discussed campaign arrangements with Buhari and then told reporters is a sign that the president may have given his approval. DISENCHANTMENT \nOn Jan. 20 an office for the organization of the campaign will be set up in Nigeria’s southwest, Shittu said. \nThe southwest is a key region in Nigerian elections, home to the sprawling megacity of Lagos, where widespread support for Buhari in 2015 is credited with helping him defeat the incumbent Goodluck Jonathan. \nBut while Buhari in 2015 rode a wave of resentment against Jonathan over endemic government corruption, a struggling economy and a failure to defeat the Islamist Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast, much of public opinion has now turned against Nigeria’s incumbent leader. \nMany Nigerians complain that Buhari’s government is also corrupt, pointing to the president’s sacking of his top civil servant and the head of the National Intelligence Agency in October after highly-public graft scandals. \nOthers dispute how well the economy, Africa’s largest, has recovered. Nigeria exited its first recession in 25 years in the second quarter of 2017, but growth remains sluggish and the country continues to depend on oil, while unemployment and underemployment have increased. \nBoko Haram’s deadly attacks also continue to plague the military and civilians in the northeast almost daily, despite the Buhari administration’s insistence over the past two years that the insurgency has been beaten. \nIn a blow to the president, Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president and key Buhari ally, quit the ruling All Progressives Congress and said he was prepared to run in 2019. Last month he joined the opposition People’s Democratic Party.

Soybeans also closed higher after trading both sides of unchanged during the session. \nTraders were also digesting the latest export data from the U.S. Agriculture Department on the first trading day of 2018. \nWheat notched its biggest daily percentage gain since Nov. 22 as much of the crop was not protected by a blanket of snow to mitigate the freezing conditions. \n\"Damage occurred in about a quarter of the hard red wheat belt in the central Plains, with about 5 percent of the soft red wheat belt in the Midwest seeing impacts,\" Don Keeney, senior agricultural meteorologist for Radiant Solutions, said in a note. \nChicago Board of Trade soft red winter wheat for March delivery settled up 6-1/2 cents at $4.33-1/2 a bushel. Prices peaked at $4.36-1/4, matching a level last seen on Dec. 5. \nCBOT March corn futures ended 2-1/2 cents higher $3.53-1/4 a bushel. \nCBOT March soybeans gained 3 cents to close at $9.64-3/4 a bushel. \nOngoing concerns that heat in Argentina will limit the size of that country's harvest supported soybean prices. \n\"While Argentina did receive good coverage over the past week, temperatures could top 100 degrees (Fahrenheit) (37.8 C) again in some areas by the end of the week before rains return,\" said Bryce Knorr, analyst at Farm Futures. \nA shortfall in South American crop production could boost demand for U.S. exports and help alleviate the glut of domestic supplies following the recent bumper harvest. \nUSDA said on Tuesday morning that weekly U.S. soybean export inspections were 1.139 million tonnes, in line with forecasts for 1.1 million to 1.3 million tonnes. \nCorn export inspections were 683,898 tonnes, also in line with trade estimates that ranged from 575,000 to 800,000 tonnes. Export inspections of wheat totalled 274,506 tonnes, below estimates for 300,000 to 600,000 tonnes.

The Equifax breach alone affected as many as 145 million people. \nGonzalez recommends you set up text or email notifications to let you know if your data has been compromised. \nFollowing are other important moves that you want to make now. Watch your credit \nMake it a point to comb through your credit report regularly for any errors or fraudulent activity. \nYou can access a free credit report annually from each of the major credit reporting firms, Experian, TransUnion and Equifax. (Visit Annualcreditreport.com for access.) If you want more protection, you can sign up for credit monitoring, which will track your credit and keep you apprised of any dramatic changes. Courtney Keating | iStock | Getty Images Pay bills right after payday \nPaying your bills promptly ensures you don't get charged for late payments and helps keep your credit score in top shape. It also keeps you from indulging in purchases you cannot afford. David Sacks | Getty Images Pay down credit card debt \nConsumer credit card debt has climbed $61 billion in the past year to $808 billion total today , according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That debt only becomes more expensive as the Federal Reserve increases interest rates, WalletHub notes. \nSet a concrete goal for how much you want to pay down, say 20 percent of your existing debt, in the new year. Gonzalez recommends using the snowball method, where you focus on paying down the debt with the highest interest first. Daniel Grill | Getty Images Diversify your credit cards \nYou could be missing out if you are using the same credit card for regular purchases and the debt you carry over from month to month. That is because a rewards card might be better suited for regular purchases while a card that comes with a zero annual percentage rate can add up to big savings for larger balances. \nUsing distinct cards can also better help you track your spending. Ti_ser | Getty Images Build up your emergency fund \nIt always helps to have extra cash in case you face unexpected unemployment or medical emergencies. \nAdvisors recommend you initially strive for three to six months of expenses . Ultimately, you want to build that reserve up to as much as 12 months to 18 months of living costs. Cristian Baitg | E+ | Getty Images Improve your credit score \nCredit scores generally can be as high as 850, but many scores typically average between 645 to 700 . The higher your score, the better the rates you will be able to get on mortgage and car loans, as well as credit card rates. \nTo improve yours, be sure to make payments on time, Gonzalez said. That effort, combined with the length of your credit history inevitably getting longer with time, can help improve your score by at least 20 points, she said. AndreyPopov | Getty Images Increase your financial literacy \nAdding to what you know about money and personal finance will inevitably help you make smarter decisions. \nWalletHub recommends you start by assessing where you are by taking an online quiz . The results will show you where you most need to brush up. By 2019, your score on the same quiz should be higher. Maurusone | Getty Images Stick to a budget \nCreating and following a budget will help prevent you from overspending or failing to plan for future expenses. \nStart by making a list of recurring expenses, from most important to least important. If what you're spending every month exceeds what you earn, start cutting expenses from the bottom of the list. \nBe sure to periodically go back and look at your plan and make sure you are following it. \n\"It's one thing to set it and forget it,\" Gonzalez said. \"It's another thing to check in monthly.\" Peshkova | Getty Images Make more \nIncreasing your take-home pay is one key way to improve your financial well-being. Consider looking for a better job in 2018, even if it means relocating to another city. You may also want to consider finding ways to earn more in your current position, whether it be through a raise or a promotion. Nicolas Hansen | GlobalStock | Getty Images Don't forget your health \nThe average person spends $4,612 per year on health care, according to WalletHub. \nTaking care of your health now can help limit future health-care costs. Plus, those who exercise regularly tend to have higher credit scores, according to WalletHub.

The Philadelphia-based biotechnology company also revealed Wednesday morning a set of payment and access programs, including tying payments to how well the therapy works and exploring payment by installment.\nThe treatment is delivered just once, a facet of gene therapy that poses unique pricing questions in an industry fueled by steady payments for chronic therapies.\n\"It's wildly expensive but, to be very frank, I think they've priced it what I'll call responsibly,\" said Dr. Steve Miller, chief medical officer of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts , which is partnering with Spark on distribution and specialty pharmacy services for Luxturna. \"The product is just phenomenally innovative, and we've been talking about gene therapy for over 20 years. We're now at the threshold of having gene therapy reaching patients.\"\nWall Street expectations for Luxturna's price were around a million dollars, and Spark's $425,000 for each eye comes in under that mark.\n\"It came down to the value we believed was inherent in the therapy,\" Spark Chief Executive Officer Jeff Marrazzo said in an interview. He, as well as Miller, spoke with CNBC ahead of the announcement on condition the information not be published until the news was public.\n\"We also heard and did market research with payers ... and wanted to take into account the questions and challenges they had about affordability,\" Marrazzo continued. \"Ultimately this is about access.\"\nGene therapy involves the delivery, using a modified virus, of a healthy copy of a gene to make up for one that's deficient in a way that causes disease. In the retinal dystrophy Spark aims to treat with Luxturna, which the company estimates affects between 1,000 and 2,000 people in the U.S., mutations in a gene called RPE65 lead to impaired vision that deteriorates over time.\nIn clinical trials, patients' sight was assessed by their ability to navigate an obstacle course in different levels of light. Those receiving Luxturna showed significant improvement in their ability to do so at low light after a year.\nPatients who participated in the trial also described, in interviews and in testimony to a panel of FDA advisers, seeing snowflakes for the first time or being able to read again.\nA new form of medical treatment brings with it new challenges, not only in its price. Marrazzo said Luxturna will only be available at half a dozen treatment centers in the U.S. throughout this year, so Spark will ensure financial support and logistics for travel and accommodations.\nThe company also outlined several plans for new payment models that Marrazzo says aim to ensure access for patients, recognize the value of the product for Spark, and remove extra cost and risk for insurers and hospitals.\nOne is an agreement with Harvard Pilgrim, a nonprofit health plan covering 1.2 million people, to pay rebates if a patient's vision doesn't meet certain thresholds in 30 to 90 days, and then 30 months after treatment, under a model known as outcomes-based pricing.\n\"What's important and unique about the product is not just standing behind the efficacy but behind the long-term durability from a single dose,\" Marrazzo said.\nAnother recently approved one-time therapy, Novartis' Kymriah for a form of leukemia, also has an outcomes-based pledge: If the treatment isn't working after a month, Novartis doesn't get paid. That treatment is priced at $475,000.\nBoth Kymriah and another one-time cancer treatment approved in 2017, Gilead's Yescarta, are referred to by the FDA as gene therapies because they involve genetically modifying patients' own immune cells to identify cancer. They're known as CAR-T therapies.\nLuxturna is the first of a crop of treatments that target diseases caused by mutations in specific genes, and thus is referred to by many as the first gene therapy in the U.S.\nSpark also announced a program Wednesday, through a partnership with Express Scripts, to offer a way for insurers to purchase Luxturna directly, avoiding a so-called buy and bill model in which treatment centers administering a drug must purchase it upfront.\nThe goal is to remove the risk for treatment centers in purchasing, handling and waiting for reimbursement of expensive products, and to alleviate for insurers potential markup costs imposed by the treatment centers, Marrazzo said.\nHe said the company is in active discussions with additional insurers, with coverage announcements coming over the next few weeks and months.\nExpress Scripts, which in its role as a pharmacy benefit manager negotiates drug prices and reimbursement on behalf of insurers and employers, \"will work with health plans and plan sponsors to decide where they want [Luxturna] on their plans,\" Miller said. He said Express Scripts will receive a dispensing fee for its work with Spark, \"not dependent on the price of the drug.\"\nFinally, Spark is also exploring a much-discussed idea for paying for expensive, one-time treatments: staggered payments that would spread costs out over time.\nSome of the challenges for this are government requirements tying prices to the lowest available, and the fact that patients switch health insurance providers numerous times over the course of their lives — an average of every three years, according to Spark.\nMarrazzo said the company is in talks with the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, including Administrator Seema Verma, on a proposal that would waive some of those requirements, enabling it to offer an installment payment option and bigger rebates linked to how well the treatment works.\n\"We're at the infancy of what I think could be a lot of innovations in how we pay for these really expensive drugs,\" Express Scripts' Miller said. \"We've got to figure this out, because — let's be frank — there are going to be more of these drugs coming to the marketplace for even bigger populations.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T15:34:36.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

I hope you all had a joyful holiday. Today’s Broadsheet is a bit of a catch-up edition, featuring some of the big stories that caught my eye over the past week or so. Here’s to a happy and productive 2018! \nEVERYONE'S TALKING [bs_bullet_primary] Taking action in 2018 . In the final Broadsheet of last year, I asked all of you to share any thoughts you might have on what we can do in 2018 to advance the next stage of the #MeToo movement--steps that will change the culture that has allowed sexual harassment and other abuses toward women to quietly flourish. Thank you to all of you who sent in your inspiring ideas, some of which I've included (in edited form) below:\n\"One of the biggest issues I see is that many women have no one to turn to when they have an issue with harassment. Their boss is often the problem, and HR focuses on protecting the company. Since many companies can't seem to police themselves, I think there needs to be an external group that holds companies accountable for getting rid of predators. Some thoughts for what this could look like: - A government organization similar to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that would be open to public complaints and able to do its own investigations. - Industry-level groups that hold their companies accountable. - A nonprofit or group of lawyers who set up a confidential complaint line for women who want to make them aware of harassment problems...they could give guidance, or even prosecute companies if they have enough evidence.\" -- Joy S.\n\"We need a consistent set of definitions of harassment behavior and consequences that would spread throughout the American workplace. This would negate the often heard 'I am not sure what's acceptable, etc.' excuse that leaves us nowhere.\" -- Anne K.\n\"I think we need 1.) a way to investigate claims that is fair to all sides, punishments appropriate to the seriousness, and a path to redemption for the redeemable. I know these aren't universally held points of view, but I believe it might encourage people to speak up if they feel the process is just, not only for an accuser, which is critically important, but as well for someone who is accused. And 2.) a \"certification\" for organizations to show they are respectful environments. It could include survey data about perceptions of safety/respect, qualitative data, metrics, and the presence of and trust in processes for people who have been harassed. Somehow it needs to show where there is real safety and respect, and not just the window dressing.\" -- Jonathan B.\n\"Companies should also consider tools which allow anonymous reporting via text, email, phone, etc. Reporting sexual harassment is difficult. Often, it's easier done anonymously or via email. And, at a time when younger generations are becoming more comfortable with digital communication and less comfortable with face-to-face communication, we, HR, should adapt for cases like this. These anonymous reporting tools are going to be important in getting people to report issues they otherwise may not be comfortable reporting to a person. Just knowing it's there is a great message to employees.\" -- Beth S.\n\"The vast majority of companies already have policies or practices in place, but what this recent uptick in attention sparked was a realization that policies don't mean much if your employees don't fully understand what harassment is. It comes in many different forms and is often subtle. 2018 is an opportunity for education - not only around what harassment looks like and feels like but what to do and how to speak up when you see it.\" -- Katie. S\nAs many of you noted, this will not be a quick or simple fix, so I'd like to make it a standing request: Please email me anytime at kristen.bellstrom@fortune.com with your thoughts on what each of us can be doing to make 2018 the year of #NoMore. I'll share your responses with your fellow readers on a regular basis--let's keep this conversation going for as long as it takes.\nALSO IN THE HEADLINES [bs_bullet_primary] Time's Up . More than three hundred Hollywood women yesterday revealed their own action plan to fight systemic sexual harassment in their industry and in blue-collar workplaces nationwide. Called Time's Up, the plan includes legislation to penalize companies that tolerate persistent harassment, a fresh push for gender parity at studios and talent agencies, and a request that women walking the red carpet at the Golden Globes speak out and raise awareness by wearing black. But the most notable aspect is a $13 million legal defense fund for less privileged women who experience sexual misconduct. You can sign the letter of solidarity--and donate to the fund here .

While this New York Times investigation is not the first media report of a sexual harassment problem at Vice Media, it paints a uniquely scathing portrait of a \"top-down ethos of male entitlement at Vice, where women said they felt like just another party favor at an organization where partying often was an extension of the job.\" The story reports that more than two dozen women say they've experienced or witnessed sexual misconduct at the company and reveals four settlements involving allegations of sexual harassment or defamation against Vice employees, including its current president.

In light of #MeToo and the numerous powerful men who've lost their jobs over sexual harassment allegations, some corporate board directors are--for the first time--saying that they would fire their company's CEO if past offensive behavior came to light during his or her tenure. In another sign of the times, other boards report that they're beefing up CEO candidate background checks to make sure any such behavior comes to light before they land in the corner office.

New York Times and Morning Consult polled 615 men about their behavior at work over the past year, finding that roughly a third admitted doing at least one thing that qualifies as sexual harassment or other objectionable behavior.

It's a bit harder to buy than bitcoin, however, since it's not available in popular apps such as Coinbase. We'll walk you through how to buy some, by first buying ethereum and then using that to buy ripple on an exchange called Bitsane. Frank and Helena | Cultura | Getty Ripple coin \nIf you thought bitcoin was hot, maybe you should learn about ripple. It's another crytocurrency that's been rocketing in popularity lately. \nWhile it was trading at around $0.20 a few months ago, it's now worth more than $2.25 per coin. Ripple is a little different than many other popular cryptocurrencies because it was created by a private, for-profit company that is still the biggest individual owner of the currency. \nBut ripple isn't as easy to buy as bitcoin or other popular cryptocurrencies, since it isn't available in popular apps such as Coinbase. \nThat means you need to jump through a few hoops to buy it. I tried several methods and think I've come up with the easiest: Create an account with a Ripple exchange \nOnly some of ripple's recommended exchanges include support for buying Ripple with the U.S. dollar, which would be the easiest way. Unfortunately, after trying several and running into technical issues or login problems, I settled on an exchange called Bitsane . \nSetting up an account is easy, and the main page has all sorts of information on current exchange prices for trading between various cryptocurrencies. It also lets you send and receive currency from other apps, such as Coinbase, which we'll get to in a moment. Buy bitcoin or ether \nNow you'll need to buy another cryptocurrency: either bitcoin or ether (the cryptocurrency associated with the Ethereum blockchain). \nIt's annoying that you need to do this extra step, but unfortunately it's the easiest way to move forward. \nI used Coinbase to buy ether and bitcoin. It's easy to use and you can buy it using the U.S. dollar, either through a linked bank account or debit card. Follow our guide on how to buy bitcoin and ethereum for this step . \nIn this case, I'm buying $200 worth of ether. Move your ether to Bitsane \nNext, you're going to move the ether you own in Coinbase over to the Bitsane platform so you can use it to buy ripple. I know it sounds complicated, but it isn't. \nDo this: Click \"Balances\" on the top of the Bitsane page. On the \"Ethereum\" line, select \"Deposit.\" The page will generate a special address. Copy it. Open Coinbase on your phone or computer. Tap Accounts Tap the \"Send\" icon on the top right. It looks like a paper airplane. Choose how much you want to send. We'll do $100 worth of ether. Enter the address you copied from Bitsane. Click Send. You'll pay a small fee -- I paid $0.36 -- and it should arrive in your Bitsane account within 30 minutes. Buy ripple using ether \nNow that your ether is in your Bitsane account, you can use it to buy ripple. On the top of the page, select the XRP/ETH exchange. This allows you to buy ripple using ether, and shows you the buy orders (bids), sell orders (asks), and current trades. Choose how much you want to buy. Under order type, select \"market\" and then choose your order size (how many ripple coins you want to buy.) Since I have 0.11712345 ether, I can buy 46 Ripple coins, which is about $2.20 a pop give or take a few cents. View your ripple \nYou can see how much ripple you now own under balances. Here we can see I ended up with about 45.88 full ripple coins. \nNow, since I can't really spend ripple anywhere, I can just sit on it and see what happens. As with most cryptocurrencies, you're taking a bet here on whether the value is going to increase or decrease. But unlike bitcoin, you can actually buy several of these at once without spending too much money.

Midlevel versions cost a bit more than twice as much. \nApple failed to ship its $349 HomePod speaker in 2017, as it initially planned, and said the device would go on sale in early 2018. \nApple aims to make a profit on the device itself and bolster sales of its $9.99 per month Apple Music subscription, analysts said. Apple’s voice assistant Siri likely will focus on recommending new songs. \nAmazon and Google, meanwhile, are eager to give consumers a taste of their respective digital assistants, Alexa and Google Assistant, at impulse-buy prices, hoping to lock in customers and profit from later sales of goods and data about buying habits. \nThe Home Mini and Echo Dot do not match the sound quality of the HomePod, but consumers may see less need for a superior, pricier speaker from Apple once they have a rival set up. Even the midlevel Amazon and Google devices were discounted to $79 over the holidays. \n“That kind of pricing is great for consumers and bad for Apple,” said Paul Erickson, a senior analyst with IHS Markit. Slideshow (2 Images) \nSome consumers might consider a $30 speaker to be cheap enough to throw away and not a barrier to buying the Apple device when it arrives. \nAmazon declined to comment on Echo devices but said in a press release it sold millions of its Echo Dot speakers during the holiday season, making it the best-selling product over the period on its online store. \nGoogle did not disclose sales numbers for the Home Mini, but Google Home spokeswoman Nicol Addison said the company was very happy with holiday performance. Google gave away the devices to buyers of its new Pixel 2 smartphones and offered them for $29 at Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy. \nAmazon dominates the emerging market for smart speakers outside of China, with Google closest behind. Sales of the devices are not yet substantial enough to affect the financial results of either company. \nBoth companies took small losses or broke even on sales of the hockey puck-shaped devices, analysts estimated. \nThe Echo Dot has about $31 worth of parts, according to analysis by ABI Research. Components in the Google Home Mini cost about $26. The figures do not include overhead, shipping and other expenses, meaning discounted versions likely sold at a loss. \n“Apple is in a bit of trouble,” said Adam Wright, senior research analyst at IDC, who estimated that about 35 million smart speakers had been installed worldwide as of a couple of weeks ago - not including U.S. Christmas sales. “We’ve witnessed an explosion in the last six months.” \n(This version of the story has been refiled to delete extra “said” in paragraph nine) Reporting by Paresh Dave and Stephen Nellis; editing by Peter Henderson and Grant McCool", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T14:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T14:16:12.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

New Year's resolution time. And for many, the clock of failure is already ticking. What's the difference between those who stick to their New Year's resolutions and those who don't?\nClarity of purpose. And a plan.\nSo says business and life coach Tony Robbins.\n\"Happy New Years everyone! Research shows that 80% of people give up on their New Years resolution by the 2nd week of February!\" writes Robbins in an Instagram post. \"The reason? What most people call 'resolutions' are really just desires or fun things they wish would happen. The majority of people aren't actually resolving anything within themselves.\n\"If you want to be a part of the few that do versus the many that talk, you need to be crystal clear— what specific result will you accomplish? What's your WHY (reasons come first, answers come second)? How will you do it? What tools, strategies, or resources do you need to make it happen? \"\nThose who stick to their resolutions have an understanding of why they are doing what they are doing, Robbins says. There has to be a larger motivating drive underpinning the goal. And when you set your goals (not just at the new year) be sure they make you truly excited, Robbins says.\nTweet: The secret to unleashing your true power is setting goals that are exciting enough to ignite your passion.\nTake for example billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk , who is CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX. He gets a lot done in part because he has a strong \"why.\"\n\"The thing that drives me is that I want to be able to think about the future and feel good about that,\" says Musk , speaking to a group of governors gathered in July. \"We are doing what we can to have the future be as good as possible, to be inspired by what is likely to happen and to look forward to the next day.\"\nOnce you have established an understanding of why your resolution is important, the next step is to create a strategy and to identify the tools that will help you manifest what you want, says Robbins. Without a plan, your resolution will remain a pipe dream.\nTo begin to make your goal reality, put pen to paper. \"Commit yourself even further and write it down for yourself to review every day this year,\" says Robbins on Instagram.\nThough writing down a goal may sound like surprisingly simple advice, Robbins isn't alone in his recommendation. Billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson says its his top tool for success.\n\"Ever since I was a child I have made lists of all kinds, including short-term tasks, long-term goals and resolutions. It's how I make sense of the world, bring order to the ideas in my head, and start turning them into action,\" writes Branson, in a 2017 New Year's Day post on his blog .\nOnce you have established a goal, understand your motivation and set a plan of action, then keep trying.\n\"No matter how many mistakes you make or how slow you progress, you are still way ahead of everyone who isn't trying,\" Robbins says.\nTweet 4\nSee also:\nThis is the No. 1 trait of great leaders, says a Wharton professor who's studied thousands of executives\nWharton's No. 1 professor: 'Never give up is bad advice.

They are hungry for food & for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!” \nAs many as a dozen people may have died in the protests, according to state TV and local reports. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, seeking to calm the unrest, on Sunday defended the Iranian people’s right to protest while urging them to work with his administration to address what he said were justified grievances about the economy. \nThose comments came after Rouhani’s government restricted access to social media, which has become an important source of information about the protests. \nThe rare public show of dissent comes at a time when prices and joblessness are on the rise and Trump’s administration has placed additional sanctions on the country. Trump said on Twitter a day before that the U.S. will be watching “very closely” for human rights violations during the protests. \nIn another Twitter posting on New Year’s Day, Trump called out Pakistan and said his administration was seeking to get tougher with that nation. In October he said leaders there were beginning to respect the U.S. again and pointed to the release of a U.S. woman and her Canadian born husband as proof the country is working with the U.S. \nPakistan is a partner with the U.S. in the fight against terrorism, yet it was was also the hiding place where 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden lived for years before being killed in a nighttime raid by Navy Seals. \n“The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!” Trump tweeted.

The pilot, Gareth Morgan, 44, also died. \nCousins had been due to retire on March 31. \nCompass said the new chief executive, Dominic Blakemore, would now start on Jan. 1 instead of April 1 as originally planned. \nCompass, with annual turnover of almost 23 billion pounds ($31 billion), employs around 550,000 people around the world providing food services to schools, the armed forces and office workers. \nBlakemore, who has worked at Compass since 2012 with roles as both finance director and head of the group’s European operations, has a background in accounting. He has also held senior financial roles at British food groups Cadbury and Birds Eye Iglo. \nCompass Chairman Paul Walsh said in a statement: “The thoughts of everyone at Compass are with Richard’s family and friends, and we extend our deepest sympathies to them.” \n“Richard was known and respected for his great humanity and a no-nonsense style that transformed Compass into one of Britain’s leading companies,” he added. \nCousins led Compass over the past 11 years. He was widely credited with turning the company’s business around and making Compass into one of the FTSE 100’s best-performing firms, and had also been named as one of the world’s best-performing CEOs by Harvard Business Review. \nHe joined Tesco ( TSCO.L ) as an independent director in 2014 at the height of the British supermarket chain’s accounting scandal, stepping down from that role at the start of 2017. \nThe family are believed to have been flying back to Sydney from an exclusive waterfront restaurant in Jerusalem Bay when the plane crashed, the BBC reported. \nPolice are working with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau to recover the wreckage of the plane, which is submerged in 13 meters of water near Cowan, north of Sydney. A probe into the cause of the crash has begun, with a preliminary report expected within 30 days. Authorities have warned it may take up to a year to find out what happened. \nThe seaplane was part of the Sydney Seaplanes business that offers sight-seeing trips and has operated since 2005 with no previous record of mishap. Seaplane flights have been canceled until further notice. \nCousins’ son William worked at Open Britain, a group campaigning to keep Britain in the European Union single market, and directors and co-workers praised him as an enthusiastic and talented team member.

Back then, it was deforested and severely depressed. They bought their 40 acres for a resounding $9,000, or just over $55,000 today . Now, their property is worth millions. \nThe Hesslers live in a house that they built, eat food that they grow and use electricity that they produce. That was always their dream: To live self-sufficiently, plus settle down somewhere Tom could focus on his artwork. \n\"If I had to describe your land to somebody, I couldn't,\" Marcus Lemonis tells the couple, now in their 70s, who he visits on Tuesday's episode of CNBC's \"The Profit .\" \"It's like in a fairytale book. It's so beautiful and so removed.\" CNBC Tom and Karen Hessler with Marcus Lemonis on CNBC's \"The Profit\" \nPot-farming wasn't originally part of the Hesslers' plan, but, as they found, it was a way to make money. \"We are the people who started this industry. There was nobody growing weed. There was nobody here, Marcus. Every piece of land was for sale,\" Tom says. \n\"You could've bought the whole mountain for 100 bucks,\" Lemonis jests, and Tom replies that you actually could have for just $36,000. \n\"Today it'd be $36 million,\" the host then speculates, which illustrates the millions the Hesslers' own property is worth today. \nAs some of the earliest growers in the region, the Hesslers helped establish Humboldt as what Lemonis calls the \"pot capital of the U.S.\" M ore farms gradually sprung up in the region through the '70s, and, by the '80s, Humboldt's economy was booming as the region supplied cities throughout the U.S. \nFor many, like the Hesslers, it has been a lucrative business. But that doesn't mean it has been easy. Farmers have faced the constant threat of crackdown from law enforcement, which persisted even after medical marijuana was legalized in Calif. with Proposition 215 in 1996. \nThe Hesslers' children, Nya and Elan, recall constantly wondering whether their parents were going to be arrested as they grew up. \n\"Certain kids in school you avoided because, like, their dad was a sheriff,\" says Nya, who recounts an incident where he was chased for 45 minutes by a helicopter through the woods by their property. \"I just finally just stopped and sat there and waited, and then they finally just flew off.\" \nLemonis interviews another Humboldt County grower who wasn't so lucky. At 29-years-old, with no prior criminal record, Johnny Casali was caught with 1500 marijuana plants. \"I woke up at 6 o'clock in the morning. Thirty federal agents showed up at my door, guns to my head,\" he says. He served eight years in prison. CNBC Foundation of the Hessler's home in 1971 \nAs of the New Year, recreational marijuana use is permitted in California, which now has the biggest legal marijuana market in the world. However, that doesn't mean growers are totally protected. \nAs Lemonis notes, the threat of federal enforcement remains. And many farmers struggle financially with a supply glut driving prices down and taxes cutting into their profits — steep enough that some continue to sell on the black market to avoid them. \nFor the Hesslers who have gone legal, however, business is booming. They just had one of their best summers ever. \"The weather's just been perfect. Absolutely perfect,\" says Tom. \nBut he's also put off by some of the recent competition brought by newcomers with no ties to Humboldt County looking to break into the industry. \n\" We've been doing this for 50 years,\" he says. \"And for almost 50 years people have been chasing us, chastising us, and trying to destroy us. Now they all want to be in with us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T01:06:30.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Macy's also said at the time it would close 34 more stores \"over the next few years\" as leases or operating covenants expired, or as sale transactions were completed. Those closures are beginning to roll out in 2018 as Macy's looks to generate much-needed cash from its real estate. Adam Jeffery | CNBC Macy's flagship store in Herald Square, New York City. \nLittle by little, Macy's is beginning to close some of the roughly 30 stores it previously announced were on the chopping block. So far, 11 stores have been identified for closure, and four of those stores' teams have been notified, the company told CNBC Wednesday. \nAbout this same time last year, Macy's posted disappointing holiday sales and simultaneously released the locations of more than 60 stores it planned to close in 2017. Additionally, the company said at the time it would close 34 more stores \"over the next few years\" as leases or operating covenants expired, or as sale transactions were completed (making 100 closures in total). \nBusiness Insider said Wednesday that more closures were coming in 2018 from that group of 34 locations. An official announcement has yet to be made from the department store chain, but one is expected to come later this week based on the timing of past press releases. \nAmong the closures is reported to be a Macy's location at Fountain Place in Cincinnati, Ohio, where the retailer is headquartered, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer . \nMacy's shares closed Wednesday down 3.7 percent on the news after rallying for most of the day Tuesday . \n\"Macy's, Inc. has been reviewing its real estate portfolio across the country to see if there are opportunities to improve the use of our assets,\" Macy's told CNBC in a statement. \n\"While closing a store is always a difficult decision because of the impact on our customers, our associates and the community, we deeply appreciate the loyalty of our customers and associates,\" the company added. \nThe Cincinnati-based retailer has said it wants to focus on its best real estate while investing more in its web operations, in a push to win more shoppers online. \n\"We're getting better and better at this because, as we've closed more stores, we've learned a lot about how to retain sales in other stores,\" CFO Karen Hoguet said on a call with analysts and investors, discussing the closures of 2017. \nMeantime, Macy's is testing smaller versions of its off-price concept, Macy's Backstage, inside some of its existing stores, which appeals to customers looking for more of a \"treasure hunt\" shopping experience. The department store chain, like its peers, has been forced to revise its massive floor plans, as fewer shoppers venture to America's malls to ring up purchases. \nHaving faced pressure before from activist investor Starboard ( which sold its stake in the company in 2017 ) to separate its real estate from its retail business, Macy's has still been taking steps to make money from those assets. \nManagement updated analysts and investors this past November , saying Macy's would continue to explore opportunities with Brookfield Asset Management on about 50 properties, including the department store chain's flagship Herald Square location in New York. \nMacy's has also struck deals in the past with some of its landlords, including General Growth Properties , to sell locations and generate cash in a pinch. \nAhead of this year's key holiday shopping season, Macy's, like many of its retail peers, was touting its ability to lure shoppers into its stores, where it has been making bigger investments in customer service and loyalty. \nCEO Jeff Gennette has already told CNBC the company started the holiday season on a strong note compared with 2016. Promotions were also less severe, he said, which should be helping profit margins. Top-selling items included coats, boots, sweaters and fragrances. \nAs of its fiscal third quarter, Macy's operated roughly 860 stores under various brands, including Macy's, Macy's Backstage, Bloomingdale's, and Bluemercury. \nShares of the department store chain have fallen more than 25 percent over the past 12 months. \n— CNBC's Courtney Reagan contributed to this reporting.

An acquisition of Target would be Amazon's largest yet. Target has a lot of company-owned real estate and its business is a mishmosh of offerings. SHARES Mark Kauzlarich | Bloomberg | Getty Images Pedestrians walk past the Target logo reflected in a window at City Point in Brooklyn, New York. \nLoup Ventures' Gene Munster is predicting the internet e-commerce company will buy Target in 2018. Industry sources aren't so sure. \nCertainly, Target's stock has swooned over the past year, and sources suggest it may need to do something transformative to address its challenges. It is the \"lost child\" of retailers, with no clear core competency (though a strong home and apparel business). It is unclear that a sale to Amazon though is in its future. \nAs a starting point, it is important to keep in mind that Amazon is prudent in its acquisitions and does not do many large-scale ones. Acquiring Target would be its largest deal yet. When Amazon does a big deal, it is looking for explicit capacities it lacks in areas it has already found challenging. \nWhen Amazon bought Whole Foods, it had been studying, investing and struggling to manage the business of fresh food for a long time prior. Whole Foods gave Amazon a strong brand name in the fresh food industry, expertise in managing foods and distribution centers for that food. \nIt similarly can be said for Amazon's $847 million acquisition of Zappos, which followed Amazon's unsuccessful dalliance with selling shoes and accessories through Endless.com. At the time of the Zappos deal, Endless was receiving 777,000 visitors a month according to Comscore, while Zappos got 4.5 million visitors, the New York Times then reported . \nThe question Amazon therefore faces in evaluating a Target deal are: 1) How much does Target offer that Amazon can't already do on its own; 2) Does Amazon need whatever Target does offer so badly that it justifies a purchase of a company with a market capitalization of $36 billion. \nHere are the considerations: Target's business is a mishmosh \nTarget is a little bit of this, a little bit of that — its roughly $70 billion in sales are scattered nearly equally across its various businesses. \nIn 2016, household essentials (pharmacy, beauty, etc.) generated 22 percent of its sales; food generated 22 percent; apparel and accessories generated 20 percent; furnishings and decor generated 19 percent and hardlines (electronics, sporting goods, etc.) generated 17 percent of its sales. \nMany of these businesses, particularly household essentials, home and hardlines, are areas in which Amazon already excels (it might, though, benefit from Target's furniture sales). It is therefore not clear that adding Target's hold on the those businesses would do much more than cannibalize Amazon's own sales. \nFood, meanwhile, is an area in which Target has struggled . Not to mention, Amazon already has a foothold into the space through its Whole Food's acquisition. \nApparel might be the one channel in which Target, at this moment, surpasses Amazon. It is also an industry Amazon seems to care about: It has invested in private label brands , launched a try- before-you-buy service and even patented a mirror that dresses you in virtual clothes. \nTarget has been largely successful in its clothing business, particularly in its private label ventures. Its Cat & Jack brand crossed the $2 billion mark a year after its launch. Target plans to launch at least 12 more brands on the heels of its success. \nBut part of Target's private label success has come from its focus away from selling third-party brands as a means of driving people into its stores and off of Amazon. Amazon, meanwhile, has been courting brands to sell on its website, including Nike . \nFurther, while Target has had success with private label, it is not clear that Amazon could not (or is not) successfully doing private label apparel on its own. Target's footprint is vast \nIt is unclear that Amazon needs to add Target's 1,834 stores. Target owns, not leases, the majority of its real estate. If Amazon buys Target, it also acquires its unproductive or less profitable stores and would be stuck managing them. Target, meanwhile, has been focusing on shifting its retail strategy, focusing on smaller and more productive stores in more urban locations. \nShould Amazon buy a retailer for its real estate, a more natural (and cheaper) choice might be Bed Bath & Beyond. A number of its leases are due to go up in the next couple of years, making it easier to roll off less attractive real estate. \nAmazon, like many other e-commerce companies, is increasingly appreciating the importance of brick and mortar. Stores help lower the cost of returns, shipping and marketing. \nBut Amazon's real estate plays so far have been very specific. Its Whole Foods acquisition helped it solve the unique problem of delivering fresh food, which requires infrastructure. It also signed a partnership with Kohl's last year, allowing shoppers to return items to Amazon from Kohl's stores. \nNot to mention, Amazon also already has roughly 322 distribution points, according to MWPVL International , a logistics consulting service. Integrating would be a challenge \nAmazon has certainly flirted with big box retailers, including its partnership with Kohl's. But partnering with a big box retailer and owning one are very different. In buying a big box retailer, Amazon also buys the headaches that come with it. \nOne of the biggest challenges of marrying the two is managing inventory and returns. Amazon has trained shoppers to become used to the \"extended aisle\" of online shopping — an endless assortment of products that are not sold in stores. Returns of these items for traditional retailers have become complicated and costly. \nStores can be left with \"orphan products\" — a random sweater they have no way to display, because a store doesn't typically sell it. Finding the sweater's way back home to a distribution center is also expensive. This seemingly minuscule problem can build up over time. \nNot to mention, consumer spending on apparel is dropping .

They had repeatedly said the court was under the influence of politicians. \nAnother 11 lawmakers face the same charges and are awaiting verdicts. \nKosovo’s government says the border accord with Montenegro is an important condition for its citizens to eventually benefit from a visa-free travel regime with the European Union. \nBut Vetevendosje, which became the single biggest party in the parliament after June elections, opposes the deal. They say that by ratifying the agreement, Kosovo would hand over some 8,000 hectares (19,700 acres) of its land to Montenegro. \nThe party also opposes a 2013 EU-brokered deal between Serbia and Kosovo that gives more autonomy to Kosovo’s Serb minority. \nIn November last year another party member was sentenced to eight years in jail for taking part in a grenade attack on the parliament building in 2016. \nKosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, nearly a decade after NATO bombing drove Serb forces from the territory.

Under the plan, the levy on soy derivatives is due to fall to 15 percent by 2020, the ministry's statement said. \nArgentina is the world's top exporter of soymeal livestock feed and its third biggest supplier of raw soybeans. \n(Reporting by Maximilian Heath and Hugh Bronstein, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T01:08:56.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

League leader Matteo Salvini hit back on Wednesday.\n“Free interpretations of my thinking make me laugh,” he told la Repubblica newspaper. “I remain convinced ... that the euro under these conditions was an error. Which we will put right.”\nAllied with France’s National Front in the European Parliament, the League blames the euro for rising poverty in the bloc, saying it only favors economic powerhouse Germany.\nOnce one of the most pro-EU nations in Europe, Italy has become more hostile towards Brussels in recent years. A survey released by the Bertelsmann Foundation last October showed 83 percent of Italians were not satisfied with the direction of the EU against an average of 66 percent across the 28-nation bloc.\nThe anti-system 5-Star Movement has also seized on this disaffection, pledging a referendum on euro membership if Brussels does not agree to change the bloc’s fiscal rules. [nL8N1OI4XS]\nFILE PHOTO: Northern League party leader Matteo Salvini looks on during an interview with Reuters in Rome, Italy November 30, 2016. REUTERS/Tony Gentile/File Photo But in France, the National Front’s anti-euro stance contributed to a bruising defeat at the hands of pro-EU centrist Emanuel Macron last spring. Marine Le Pen’s party has since softened its position, leaving the Northern League more isolated within Europe in its push for a euro-exit. [nL8N1MM3VG]\n“Before, we had a concrete hope of creating a group of nations that could have immediately demolished the euro ... Sadly we no longer have that, so we need to approach it unilaterally,” Claudio Borghi Aquilini, the League’s head of economic policy, told Reuters.\n“Our plan is still to try to leave the euro as soon as possible, but ‘as soon as possible’ means being ready to do so,” he said, giving no indication of how long it would take.\nOne of the League’s flagship proposals is to introduce a parallel currency for domestic use, issuing small-denomination bonds to firms and individuals owed money by the state.\nBorghi said such instruments could become a sovereign currency in an emergency.\nBerlusconi, who cannot run personally in the election because of a tax fraud conviction, also proposes a dual currency, but does not back abandoning the euro.

He pointed to bullish momentum in the chart. \n\"We're still very much in an uptrend. We've corrected right back to the uptrend support line. It looks, to us ... purely based upon the charts ... we could see a measured move up to $230 on Netflix,\" Johnson said Tuesday on CNBC's \" Trading Nation .\" \nThe stock rose 55 percent last year, and is up 7 percent in 2018 thus far. The upside comes on the back of bullish analyst coverage out Tuesday morning. Equity analysts at Macquarie upgraded Netflix, raising the firm's rating to outperform from neutral. Analyst Tim Nollen raised price targets on the stock, as well. \n\"We are upgrading NFLX from Neutral to Outperform as part of a broad realignment of views on media, where we prefer companies with subscription over ad-driven content, and scaled distribution with an international presence,\" Nollen wrote in a note to clients, adding that the company has \"changed the way people watch TV\" in an ever-changing media landscape. \nMeanwhile, a shift in the way people consume media at large played a part in Nollen's Disney upgrade in a separate research note, in which the stock's price target and rating were raised. \n\"In an increasingly concentrated space where content is still king but now requires direct-to-consumer distribution, Disney has by far the highest chance of success, in our view,\" the analyst wrote, adding the Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox marriage is a positive factor. \nAt this juncture, in the media space, Disney is the clear pick over Netflix if investors are considering the two stocks, said Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, who primarily looks at value names over growth. \nTo be sure, Disney underperformed the broader market in 2017, rising 3 percent in a raging bull market, while Netflix shares gained 55 percent. \n\"I would prefer Disney over Netflix. I do know it's an old media company; it's a quality company with quality assets. The real issue is that the entire industry of entertainment is now having these new competitors come in, like the Amazons of the world, Netflix and Google. So the distribution channels have completely changed,\" Morganlander said Tuesday on \"Trading Nation.\" \n\"We do like Disney. From a valuation perspective it makes sense, from a credit rating perspective it makes sense. Netflix, on the other hand ... we're value investors. That's more of a momentum name. It is a platform that we believe strongly in over 10 years. We just think that it needs the earnings to fill in, the free cash flow to fill in before we become a little bit more optimistic on that name,\" he said. \nShares of Netflix rallied 2 percent Wednesday, while Disney shares were modestly higher.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T23:35:56.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Baker 3 Min Read \nNEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Music streaming service Spotify has filed confidentially with U.S. regulators for an initial public offering and is targeting a direct listing in the first half of 2018 that would allow some longtime investors to cash out, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. \nIf Spotify, which was valued at as much as $19 billion last year, goes ahead with its plans, it would be the first major company to carry out a direct listing, an unconventional way to pursue an IPO without raising new capital. \nA direct listing mainly eliminates the need for a Wall Street bank or broker to underwrite an IPO along with many associated fees and could change the way companies approach selling shares to the public. \nThe confidential filing was initially reported by news outlet Axios. \nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission now allows all companies, regardless of revenue, to file a draft IPO registration statement confidentially before they unveil their financials. \nSpotify is the biggest global music streaming company and counts Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) and Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ) as its main rivals. Reuters had previously reported Spotify was aiming to file for an IPO in late 2017 and list with the New York Stock Exchange early this year. \nSpotify declined to comment. \nSpotify was sued by Wixen Music Publishing Inc last week for allegedly using thousands of songs without a license and compensation to the music publisher. Wixen is seeking damages worth at least $1.6 billion. \nSpotify intends to proceed with a U.S. direct listing in the first half of 2018 despite the lawsuit, according to a source familiar with the matter. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Allen & Co are helping arrange the listing, the source added. \nThe lawsuit is unlikely to have a major impact on Spotify’s IPO, said Luke DeMarte, a copyright lawyer at Michael Best & Friedrich not involved. DeMarte said he expects Wixen to settle its case for far less than the damages it is seeking and that it is unlikely any of the publisher lawsuits go to trial. \n“It is not in Wixen’s interests or its constituents’ interests to stop Spotify or really inflict harm on them because it is the main game in town for streaming,” DeMarte said. \nThe company said in June it had more than 140 million active users while listing more than 30 million songs. Spotify last reported more than 60 million paid users, twice that of Apple Music, its closest rival. Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York and Liana B.

A key dollar index hit a 3-1/2-month low, weighed by expectations of a slower pace of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve amid a tepid U.S. inflation picture. Fewer U.S. rate hikes than expected could help support demand for higher-yielding emerging market assets, which are seen as riskier than dollar bonds. Mexico's peso gained more than 1 percent. Investors are betting that Mexico's central bank could raise borrowing costs again in February after hiking last month, according to yields on Mexican interest rate swaps. Mexico's peso tumbled to its weakest in about 10 months in December, hurt by concerns that talks between Mexico, the United States and Canada could fail to broker a new free trade agreement. Banco Base said in a note on Monday the peso would be vulnerable to more losses ahead on free-trade jitters and could sink past 20 per dollar in the coming weeks. Also on Tuesday, a key factory index in China rose to a four-month high in December, confounding forecasts for a decline, and backing bets on resilience for the world's largest consumer of commodities, which are key exports of Latin American countries. Currencies from Brazil and Colombia strengthened close to 2 percent. Stock indexes were up throughout the region, with Brazil's benchmark Bovespa leading gains as traders unwound bets on a credit downgrade. Brazilian policymakers met in December with rating agencies to stave off a downgrade after lawmakers delayed a key vote on a plan to streamline the social security system and curb government spending. \"The market sought protection from what looked like an imminent sovereign downgrade, but that did not materialize,\" H.Commcor brokerage trader Cleber Alessie said. \nKey Latin American stock indexes and currencies at 2120 GMT: \nStock indexes daily % YTD % Latest change change MSCI Emerging Markets 1177.98 1.76 1.69 MSCI LatAm 2909.76 2.89 2.89 Brazil Bovespa 77891.04 1.95 1.95 Mexico IPC 50033.95 1.38 1.38 Chile IPSA 5618.91 0.98 0.98 Chile IGPA 28220.56 0.86 0.86 Argentina MerVal 31084.42 3.39 3.39 Colombia IGBC 11528.66 0.44 1.39 Venezuela IBC 1265.26 0.17 -96.01 Currencies daily % YTD % change change \nLatest \nBrazil real 3.2588 1.67 1.67 Mexico peso 19.4850 1.10 1.10 Chile peso 606.5 1.34 1.34 Colombia peso 2927 1.88 1.88 Peru sol 3.237 0.00 0.00 Argentina peso (interbank) 18.3900 1.41 1.14 Argentina peso (parallel) 19.2 0.42 0.16 \n(Reporting by Bruno Federowski in Sao Paulo and Michael O'Boyle in Mexico City; Editing by Susan Thomas)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T02:52:43.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

South Korea, on the other hand, is worried about the political ramifications of folding to Washington's demands.\nIt's imperative that the outcome of renegotiation works in the national interest of each country, said Wendy Cutler, a former acting deputy United States Trade Representative who was the chief U.S. negotiator for the deal, known as \"Korus.\"\nThe White House, she told CNBC, \"should not only focus on what it wants, but also see what it can do for Korea because for a negotiation to be successful, both countries need to win.\"\nTrump threatened last year to scrap the seven-year-old accord unless it were revised, but South Korean President Moon Jae-In was initially opposed to changes. Analysts say he changed his mind to avoid destabilizing the bilateral relationship as both countries work together on reigning in North Korea .

U.S. representatives are expected to focus on services, investment, products' country of origin and non-tariff measures.

U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan must approve the settlement. \nThe company said the settlement will be paid in three roughly equal installments and will affect fourth quarter results. \nInvestors sued Petrobras after prosecutors in Brazil accused former executives at the company of accepting more than $2 billion in bribes over a decade, mainly from construction and engineering companies. \nPetrobras claimed it was itself a victim, and it expressly denied wrongdoing in a securities filing on Wednesday. But its market value has plunged as the so-called Lava Jato or \"car wash\" corruption scandal has deepened. \nPetrobras said that it hoped the settlement would resolve all investor claims in the United States over the scandal. \nThe deal does not include investors who bought non-U.S.-based Petrobras securities outside the United States, according to the company. \nThe deal came just days after Brazil's securities regulator CVM formally accused eight former Petrobras executives of corruption. \nAccording to a legal filing by the regulator on Friday, the accusations relate to possible irregularities in the contracting process for three drill ships. \nAmong the accused in CVM's filing are former Petrobras chief executives Maria das Gracas Foster and Jose Sergio Gabrielli. \nThe largest securities fraud settlements in U.S. history include $7.2 billion stemming from the collapse of Enron, $6.2 billion over an accounting scandal at WorldCom and $3.2 billion over an accounting scandal at Tyco International, according to Stanford Law School's Securities Class Action Clearinghouse. \n(Reporting by Brendan Pierson in New York; Additional reporting by Gram Slattery in Sao Paulo; Editing by Jason Neely and Susan Fenton)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T12:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T17:09:31.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind,” Trump said. \nTrump said Bannon had little to do with his presidential victory in 2016 but was to blame for the loss of a Republican-held U.S. Senate seat in Alabama in December when accused child molester Roy Moore, who both Bannon and Trump had backed, lost to Democrat Doug Jones. \n“Now that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn’t as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country. Yet Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans,” Trump said. \n“Steve pretends to be at war with the media, which he calls the opposition party, yet he spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was. It is the only thing he does well,” Trump added. FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump talks to chief strategist Steve Bannon during a swearing in ceremony for senior staff at the White House in Washington, U.S. January 22, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo \nBannon expressed derision and astonishment over the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower in New York in which a Russian lawyer was said to be offering damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, according to the book “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House” by Michael Wolff. \nIn the book, Bannon called the meeting that his son arranged and that Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, also attended “treasonous” and “unpatriotic.” Bannon also was quoted as saying he was sure Trump Jr. would have taken the Russians who took part in the meeting to meet his father in Trump Tower. Slideshow (2 Images) \nThe explosive comments from a former close aide and far-right architect of Trump’s November 2016 election victory roiled the White House and the Republican president, who famously values loyalty in associates and employees. \n“The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor - with no lawyers.

The deal will also give Disney more content as it plans to launch its own streaming service to compete with services like Netflix , whose stock proved to be an even better bet over the past decade.\nDisney also plans to launch a stand-alone ESPN digital service.\nThe company \"remains best positioned in the current fragmented media landscape to leverage its content across a growing number of distribution channels, its global theme parks and consumer products,\" according to Stan Meyers, vice president and senior research analyst at investment bank and asset management firm Piper Jaffray.\nInvestors and entertainment stars alike are taking notice.

CES still doesn’t have any female keynote speakers, Rebekah Mercer is cutting off Steve Bannon, and Time’s Up will meet the Golden Globes on Sunday. Have a cozy weekend. EVERYONE'S TALKING \n• A golden opportunity . The headlines are full of entertainment news today (more on that below…) and why not? This Sunday is the Golden Globes, one of the most-watched awards shows of the year. Typically the Globes are considered the “fun show,” where celebrities help themselves (liberally) to the champagne, cut loose, and occasionally even go off script. \nBut with the #MeToo movement rocking the entertainment industry, this weekend will likely be a very different type of affair. As part of the Time’s Up initiative that we’ve been covering all week , the actors (both male and female) will be wearing black on the red carpet. While that might seem like a frivolous form of protest, Reese Witherspoon, one of the organizers, told the New York Times : “A show of solidarity at an awards show is one very small piece. It really is a statement that women are deeply unified, we always have been, and that we stand up for those who can’t speak up.” And as Eva Longoria pointed out in the same article, the dresses provide a point of entry to use those typically banal pre-show interviews to talk about real topics like sexual harassment. \nOf course, while harassment and abuse are the most acute problems faced by women in Hollywood, the Globes also point to another critical issue: Despite a number of female-fronted hits, not a single woman was nominated in the best director category this year. And that’s not a fluke: A new study finds that from 2007 to 2017, there’s been no measurable change in the percentage of major movies directed by women or people of color. \nSo while I like watching a tipsy celebrity give a goofy speech as much as the next girl, I’m looking forward to seeing Hollywood seize this moment to get serious. ALSO IN THE HEADLINES \n• CES needs women . Unbelievably, major consumer electronics show CES, which kicks off next week in Las Vegas, will not have any female keynote speakers—for the second year in a row. Not a good look, especially for an industry that is already under fire for its treatment of women. Fast Company \n• Kaplan’s on the case . In this essay from her excellent RaceAhead newsletter ( subscribe here ), my colleague Ellen McGirt looks at the first test case to make use of another aspect of Time’s Up, the crowdfunded legal defense fund: Melanie Kohler, who has been sued for defamation by Brett Ratner after alleging that he sexually assaulted her. Kohler is now being defended by Roberta Kaplan, who successfully argued before the Supreme Court to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act. Fortune \n• A real hero . Denis Mukwege is the founder and lead doctor of the Panzi Foundation in the Democratic Republic of Congo. His hospital has has treated more than 50,000 survivors of sexual violence and over 37,000 patients with gynecological injuries since 1999—and provides survivors with the mental, educational, legal, and financial tools to rebuild their lives.

AT&T is raising DirecTV's prices by up to $8 a month in mid-January. Smaller providers are planning increases, too.\nOver the past decade, prices for TV service have risen almost twice as fast as inflation, according to an analysis of government data. Data provider S&P Global Market Intelligence says customers' cable and satellite TV bills have soared 53 percent since 2007, to $100.98 in 2017.\nAnnual rate hikes are as guaranteed as death and taxes. But you can push back and trim your bill.\nWhy prices rise Cable companies point to rising fees they pay to carry TV networks. The networks, in turn, have their own rising costs — particularly sports, as they willingly pay more to sports leagues for what they consider must-have programming. But the networks also know they can pass those costs back to cable companies and ultimately their subscribers.\nIt's industry convention that a cable bundle needs live sports. Otherwise, cable companies risk losing subscribers to Netflix and other sports-less alternatives.\nThe consulting firm PwC estimates that sports leagues in North America raked in $18.4 billion in 2016 from TV, radio and tech companies that stream games, up from $11.6 billion in 2012. That's expected to keep growing as tech companies such as Amazon and Facebook become more interested in sports, meaning more competition for rights to televise games.\nThe big winner in the TV ecosystem? \"If anyone's the beneficiary it's NFL players,\" Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said.\nMeanwhile, to get the biggest audience possible, many entertainment companies like Disney require cable companies to include expensive channels in the most popular bundles. Verizon tried to offer a cheaper package by dropping Disney's ESPN from a basic package, making it an optional add-on. ESPN sued, and now Verizon offers a sports-focused basic package with ESPN alongside ones that doesn't have sports.\nBeyond sports, networks pay for high-quality TV series to compete with hits on Amazon, Netflix and other services. Those costs are passed along, too.\nIn all, S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates that network fees that cable companies are paying are nearly 2.5 times what they were a decade ago.\nPush back You can threaten to ditch your cable company in hopes of getting a discount. Companies will often offer a promotional rate for a year or two — though they may also try to get you to upgrade packages in the process. BillFixers, a service that fights on your behalf in return for a cut of your savings, estimates that 55 percent of customers are on a promotion at any given time.\nBut just having a discount doesn't mean it's a good one. BillFixers' founder, Ben Kurland, recommends calling to complain about prices and rejecting the first deal offered. More often than not, a better discount will be available if you ask for it. Repeatedly.\nIf you decide to cut one of your services, like your home phone, but you feel that you are still paying too much, Kurland advises calling back again in a month and seeing if there are any new discounts.\nCable companies are already dealing with customers dropping TV service entirely. That hurts the networks, too, as their fees are based on the number of subscribers. It's in everyone's interest to keep you as a customer, even if you are paying less.\nMany promotions are automatic after you initially sign up for service and last for a year or two. That may protect you from immediate price hikes, at least partially. Those deals don't always include equipment charges and separate fees for over-the-air networks, including ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC (yes, you're paying for them, too, even though they are free with an antenna).\nCord-cutting An increasingly popular option is to just peace out. Though there are still 94 million cable and satellite TV customers, that's roughly 4 million fewer than two years ago, according to MoffettNathanson Research.\nYou don't have to drop TV networks completely. Online TV services such as YouTube TV, DirecTV Now and Sling TV offer smaller packages of channels, often for less than what cable charges. MoffettNathanson estimates these services have 3.5 million customers combined. Make sure the service has your favorite channels, as these services have notable gaps.\nAntennas are also available for $50 or less. You get over-the-air networks for free, although reception might not be perfect.\nBe careful: Paying for online services to replace TV could eventually add up to more than a $100 cable bill, especially as more services are created to compete for your dollars. Disney, for instance, is pulling its movies from Netflix and plans its own streaming service in 2019. On the other hand, it's easy to cancel after a month or two of catching up on shows; cancelling cable is a chore by comparison.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T16:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T17:06:33.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

More than the human brain can even conceive, it turns out. Your voice offers hints about your mood, social status, upbringing, age, ethnicity, weight, height, and facial features—plus information about the environment around you. \nThe human ear cannot detect these minute inputs. But artificial intelligence? Well, that’s another story. \nSoftware, often learning from those customer service calls “recorded for training purposes,” can now pick up microsignatures in a voice that reveal telling details about the speaker. It’s a concept called “voice profiling,” and in December researchers at Carnegie Mellon University achieved a breakthrough by using artificial intelligence to generate a three-dimensional image of a speaker’s face, simply by analyzing a voice recording. “Your voice is like your DNA or your fingerprint,” says Rita Singh, who leads the research at Carnegie Mellon. \nResearch into voice analysis has been ongoing for decades, but it wasn’t until this one that the field began to make its way toward the mainstream. Today a broad constellation of voice technologies is expanding, thanks to more robust computing power and more sophisticated algorithms. \nThe U.S. Coast Guard is using Carnegie Mellon’s A.I. to build its own criminal cases against prank callers who send crews out on false search-and-rescue missions, which are costly and time-consuming. The agency receives about 150 hoax calls a year. The technology has contributed to a criminal case against one such caller—though it’s unclear whether such voice fingerprinting will hold up in court. \nA voiceprint makes it possible for your bank to have fewer security breaches because it knows that you’re you and not your evil twin sister. It also enables your car to recognize you when you slip into the driver’s seat and speak, unlocking secure apps and automatically adjusting the seat and temperature based on your preferences. (BMW, Audi, and Ford (f) are among the many carmakers working the technology with Nuance Communications, a voice technology company in Burlington, Mass.) \nAnd when you ask your TV for a good comedy, a voiceprint might prompt it to display R-rated movies rather than the G-rated ones it offers your nine-year-old daughter when she asks it the same question. Orange TV in France is working with Nuance on such an application. \n“This is the very, very beginning,” says Amy Webb, founder of the Future Today Institute, which researches technology and forecasts future tech trends. “We’re going to see dramatic shifts [in biometric and voice technology] in the next 10 years.” \nSingh hopes that her tech could one day help doctors using telemedicine identify the early onset of conditions like Parkinson’s disease. It’s the tip of the iceberg of possibility. Says Singh: “Just like your DNA defines you, your voice captures your entire persona.” \nA version of this article appears in the Jan. 1, 2018 issue of Fortune with the headline, “The Gift of Gab.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-06T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-06T14:00:13.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Volkswagen, which has been working with Aurora for the past six months, aims to launch commercial fleets of self-driving electric vehicles in two to five cities beginning in 2021, VW Group’s chief digital officer Johann Jungwirth told Fortune . These “mobility-as-a-service” fleets — a system VW Group is currently developing — will initially include smaller self-driving vehicles (like the SEDRIC pod unveiled in 2017) that people can hail as well as larger vans. Jungwirth says Aurora’s self-driving tech could be applied to other vehicle platforms as well, including autonomous trucks, delivery vans, even roving mailbox stations. \nVW hasn’t identified these initial launch cities, but Jungwirth said some will be in the U.S. \n“For me, this is a very big deal; it’s a potential partnership of the century, said Jungwirth, who noted the company’s ultimate goal is for anyone in the world to be able access self-driving vehicles and get to where they need to go with “push of a button.” \nVW Group is betting Aurora, which provides the package of software, hardware, and data services that make up the self-driving system, will get it there faster. \nAurora will also work with Hyundai to bring Level 4 self-driving vehicles to market by 2021. Under that partnership, Aurora’s tech will be integrated into Hyundai models, starting with the automaker’s new-generation hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle. Testing is expected to begin this year. \nBoth automakers want to commercialize self-driving vehicles globally. \nThe separate partnerships announced Thursday are a milestone for Aurora’s founders, Sterling Anderson, Drew Bagnell, and Chris Urmson, all early pioneers of the technology who led autonomous vehicles programs at Google (goog) , Tesla (tsla) , and Uber (uber) . Urmson led the Google self-driving program until 2016, Anderson was the former head of Tesla’s semi autonomous Autopilot program, and Bagnell helped launch Uber’s efforts in autonomy. \nWhile Volkswagen and Hyundai — with their millions of branded vehicles globally — are well-known, Aurora is far from a household name. The company, based in Palo Alto, Calif., and Pittsburgh, has operated largely in secret since it launched last January. \nAurora provides the “full-stack solution” for self-driving vehicles. This means the company will work with Volkswagen and Hyundai, and possibly other automakers in the future, to design and develop the right package of sensors, software, and data services needed to deploy fully autonomous vehicles. Aurora is focused on Level 4 autonomous systems, and eventually Level 5. Level 4 is a designation by SAE International that means the car takes over all of the driving in certain conditions. In Level 5 autonomy, a vehicle is driverless in any and all circumstances and environments. \nAurora might be tiny by every measure, but these comparative giants are counting on the company to help bring commercial self-driving vehicles to world faster. \n“It’s been quite thrilling,” said Urmson, who is CEO of Aurora. In many ways, Urmson is in a similar role as when he led Google’s self-driving project, which spun out to become its own business called Waymo in 2016. \n“But it’s quite different when it’s, you know, ‘our company;’ we were able to set the mission independently and attract the talent,” Urmson said. “And the fact that two of the world’s largest auto manufacturers share that vision with us and are willing to place a bet on us to partner with them to move this technology forward is humbling and also kind of exciting.” \nVolkswagen will deploy autonomous test vehicles developed with Aurora on public roads in 2018. Aurora has been working to integrate its self-driving system into VW’s vehicle platforms. VW vehicles are already on the road, said Anderson, who is chief product officer. However, Aurora is working on a custom vehicle with Volkswagen that is not quite ready yet, Anderson said, adding those vehicles will also be on the road testing. \nThe number of test vehicles will grow to “triple digits” in 2019, and “four digits” in 2020, before going into production in 2021, Jungwirth said.

Maybe it's because when The Aviary first opened in Chicago in 2011 people waited six hours to be among the first samplers, according to Eater . Maybe it's because at its Manhattan outpost perched on the 35th floor of the luxe Mandarin Oriental hotel, the signature cocktail comes ensconced in a bag containing the aroma of an \"everything\" bagel.\nCNBC | Andrea Kramar The Aviary NYC offers views of Columbus Circle from the 35th floor of The Madarin Oriental hotel. Whatever the reason, expectations for the self-proclaimed \"innovative\" bar run high — especially when entering a market like New York, which prides itself on cocktail craftsmanship.\nFor Alinea Group Beverage Director Micah Melton, it created a unique opportunity to defy what some might envision from a bar charging $38 for a Bloody Mary (its most expensive drink). \n\"At the end the day, it's still a bar so we don't want to take ourselves too seriously,\" he tells CNBC Make It . \"So the first thing we try to do is make it approachable and you know if you can get someone to laugh when they read the drink names then they're going to chill out a little bit.\"\nAnd while the cocktail names certainly don't sound too serious (How Does Snoop Dogg Use Lemongrass?, Boom Goes The Dynamite, Science A.F. ), what arrives on the table are among the top contenders in the progressive cocktail space.\nMelton, who started at The Aviary as an ice chef tasked with creating flavored, sculpted ice cubes in 2011, prepared a sampling of some of the restaurant's most popular drinks for CNBC Make It.\nCNBC | Mary Stevens The Aviary NYC's signature cocktails \"In the Rocks,\" \"Science A.F.\" and \"Wake and Bake\" in their finished states. \"The Wake and Bake is a cocktail that's inspired by breakfast in New York,\" he says, dropping off a Manhattan with a hint of coffee and orange liquor.\nThe $27 cocktail arrives at the table in a clear plastic bag emblazoned with The Aviary logo. Behind the bar — which is shielded by a pane of glass meant to reflect the restaurant's views of Central Park — garlic, onion, poppy seeds and sesame oil are heated in a volcano vaporizer and shot through a tube into the bag before it's sealed. When a server cuts it open, you're hit with the aroma of an everything bagel.\nGetting hit with the air of a bagel shop may put you more in the mood for bacon and eggs than a cocktail, and the gimmick of having your eyes and tastebuds experience something so different from what your nose is getting is confusing, yet it's oddly worthwhile. \nThe drink's origins stem from The Aviary's Chicago location where the concept of wrapping a bourbon cocktail in a pillow of oatmeal-scented air was born. Replacing oatmeal scents with bagel aroma was the natural move in coming to New York, explains Melton, even though it wasn't originally planned that way.\n\"The bagel was actually in the drink at first, and it didn't work out that well, he says, adding that it could take multiple iterations before he and his staff settle on a final concoction. \"A lot of it is ... trying and failing a lot of times and sometimes getting it right.\"\nNext up, Melton carries out something that looks more like a science experiment than a drink. Fittingly, The Aviary has dubbed it \"Science A.F.,\" named after the scientist who discovered penicillin, Alexander Fleming.\n\"It's a riff on the penicillin cocktail,\" Melton explains, paying homage to the 2005 creation from famous New York mixologist Sam Ross that fueled the rise of craft cocktails with its combination of Scotch, ginger and lemon. \"We kind of took that as inspiration and then added The Aviary style to it.\"\nThat style includes using a single-pot coffee brewer stuffed with fresh ginger, lemon, blueberries and honey, mixed with a combination of peated and blended Scotch. Hibiscus tea, with which the cocktail is infused, is heated over an open flame and mixed with dry ice to produce a billowing fog — it's part of the allure that allows The Aviary to charge $27 for the enjoyable drink. \nWhen it comes to taste, however, both drinks pale in comparison to the cocktail inspired by the ball drop at New York's celebration of the New Year dubbed \"In the Rocks.\"\nThe drink features a hollowed out ball of ice that's formed by the controlled freezing of a water balloon in a superchiller. Using a syringe, a drinkmaker injects the ice with the makings of an Old-Fashioned and places it in a glass atop crème-de-cassis granita. The creation is served with a half-glass of champagne for $29.\nThen comes the best part.\n\"You get the chance at the table to use a slingshot to crack the ice open,\" Melton explains, pointing to the slingshot device that's placed over the glass. \"It's, again, one of those things where we try to add something different to a really standard style of serving a cocktail.\"\nThough the focus is on cocktails, which get rotated and reimagined every few months, The Aviary also offers food in small plates. Perhaps the most eye-catching is actually not small at all, however: A $17 chicharron, listed on the menu as a \"giant crispy pork skin,\" measures in at roughly 2-feet long. Chef Dan Perretta says he can sell as many as 150 pounds worth of the salt and vinegar spiced snack in a day.\nCNBC | Andrea Kramar CNBC correspondent Zack Guzman is dwarfed by a giant, $17 chicharon. In its third month of operating, it might be too early to tell whether The Aviary NYC can attract as loyal a following as its original Chicago location, especially hidden on a high floor of an expensive hotel. A tepid review from Eater NY, in December questioned whether its possible.\nBut according to Melton, New York guests are reacting much the same way to his creations as they do in Chicago.\n\"We're having fun with it and making the drinks taste delicious and that's at the end of the day what matters,\" he says.\nVideo by CNBC's Andrea Kramar . \nDon't miss: \nThis entrepreneur is getting people to eat $100,000 of a venomous fish to save the ocean How a 33-year-old turned $200 into $1 million in 92 days selling Kevlar pants online This 24-year-old made $345,000 in 2 months by beating Kickstarters to market show chapters This entrepreneur is selling six figures worth of venomous fish to save the ocean      6:25 PM ET Thu, 2 Nov 2017 | 01:42 Like this story?

Kennedy International Airport. \nSingapore Airlines Flight 26, a 325-passenger jet flying fromFrankfurt, Germany, was an unusual sight at Stewart International when it landed there at around 1 p.m. on Thursday. Although at 11,800 feet, the runway was long enough to accommodate the A380, the airport’s gates were not high enough to reach the plane’s doors, CNBC reports . A passenger told the television channel that passengers had to exit the plane using outdoor stairs. \nWinter Storm Grayson, the blizzard that caused heavy snow, coastal flooding and treacherous travel conditions along the East Coast , has led to the cancellation of more than 3,300 flights and more than a thousand other flights being delayed. Travel headaches are particularly severe Thursday in New York and Boston, according to FlightAware’s MiseryMap . \nMajor airlines including Delta , JetBlue, United and American Airlines have been helping customers out by waiving normal flight change fees, in many cases. If you’re among the unlucky travelers dealing with cancelations, here’s a detailed list of what you can do to get your money back. \nAlthough Stewart International, in New York’s Hudson Valley, is usually home to much smaller passenger jets than the A380 (wingspan 262 feet), it’s seen it’s share of jumbo planes. The New York Air National Guard’s 105th Airlift Wing flew massive C-5 Galaxy military transports (wingspan 222 feet) out of the airport until switching to the slightly smaller C-17 Globemaster III in recent years.

In previous years, it's been home to major announcements, including new computers, TVs, smart home appliances, autonomous car technology and more.\nThis year might change a bit compared with last year, according to at least one expert interviewed by CNBC.\nCES 2018 \"is a 'fulfillment' one where we won't see as much 'vision' but more companies delivering on the promises made last year,\" Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy told CNBC.\n\"We will see improvements and refinements versus big-picture vision. We will see home automation work better, be more reliable and support more ecosystems,\" he said.\nHere's what you can expect from the show.\nAutonomous technology Elijah Nouvelage | Reuters A woman gets in a self-driving Chevy Bolt EV car during a media event by Cruise, GM’s autonomous car unit, in San Francisco, California, U.S. November 28, 2017. Autonomous cars have become a staple at CES over the past few years — and that likely won't change this year. Manufacturers from BMW to Audi offer test drives of new vehicles — Audi even drove an autonomous car from San Francisco to Las Vegas for CES 2017. \"Cars will be announced with very sophisticated driving systems that aren't automated fully, but help prevent accidents better,\" Moorhead said.\nSmart home Todd Haselton | CNBC The Echo Plus looks great around the house Expect to see lots of smart home gadgets during the show. Last year, for example, LG introduced new refrigerators with Amazon's Alexa voice assistant built in. This year, we already know that Amazon is partnering with appliance makers to build Alexa into new products such as microwaves and conventional ovens. Huge players in the space, ranging from August smart locks to Ring (makers of the Ring doorbell) and Philips Hue will be at the show with announcements, too.\n5G Getty Images Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf speaks during a keynote address at CES 2017 on January 6, 2017 in Las Vegas. Qualcomm and U.S. wireless carriers are likely to discuss 5G, the next generation of wireless networks, which should begin rolling out over the next couple of years in the U.S. AT&T confirmed this week that it will roll out 5G to customers this year, and it will offer much faster speeds than 4G LTE, the current standard. It'll be used for everything from streaming 4K video to mobile devices to connected autonomous cars.\nNew TVs LG Samsung, LG and other firms typically use CES as a launchpad for new TVs that will hit the market later in the year. \"We will see sexier, higher resolution, larger 4 and 8k TVs,\" Moorhead said.\nLG has already said it will show off the largest 8K OLED TV, which may be an early highlight of the show. Also, expect to hear about advancements in smart TV software, the interfaces that you interact with on connected television sets. LG, for example, has used CES to show new versions of its webOS software.\nLaptops and tablets Devin Hance | CNBC While Apple doesn't use CES to announce new products, its competitors still do. Expect to see new laptops from major brands, including Samsung and Lenovo, which typically use the event to show off new machines.\n\"PCs will be more refined with the addition of longer-lasting batteries and LTE and a few super-thin laptops with big gaming graphics,\" Moorhead said.\nMicrosoft recently announced a partnership with Qualcomm for new Snapdragon-powered always-connected laptops. They aren't on the market yet, and we expect to see some of the new ones firsthand during the show. One big question we'll be looking to answer: How will these compare with Intel machines?\nRobots Source: LG LG robot designed to clean airports. Don't expect Rosie from The Jetsons just yet, but we'll certainly see some new robots at CES. LG has already confirmed it will show off new concept robots during the show. Another firm, Seven Dreamers, will show off a new robot named Laundroid that's capable of folding laundry.\nSmart glasses and VR Adam Jeffery | CNBC Intel virtual reality Vive interactive demo at NYFW on Feb. 11, 2016. We'll likely see new mixed-reality headsets — or existing ones with new features — that use Microsoft's Windows 10 platform during the show. Additionally, firms such as Occipital and Madgaze plan to show off new smart glasses that use augmented reality to place digital information on top of the real world.\nOculus used to make big announcements during CES, but it already made a few late last year when it announced the standalone $199 Oculus Go headset . Facebook's competitor in the space, HTC, will be at the show with the HTC Vive. Perhaps we'll see new announcements around that platform.\nPhones Saheli Roy Choudhury | CNBC Huawei's Mate 10 Pro comes in two colors, mocha brown and midnight blue. CES was once used for new smartphone announcements, but we probably won't hear much on that front here from brands you're familiar with. Still, Huawei is expected to announce its plans to take on Apple and Samsung in the U.S., potentially with its new Mate 10 Pro smartphone and maybe even carrier partnerships — the first of its kind for Huawei. Its sub-brand, Honor, is also expected to have similar announcements. While Huawei might not be a household name in the U.S. right now, CES could be a turning point for that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T18:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T18:39:56.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Most government officials still don't believe in the new direction,\" said Xie.\nHowever, unlike officials in previous administrations, Xie said current ones are likely to be changed if they don't agree with the current economic direction, so the government will have more power to push through its agenda.\nPolicies are working toward that direction, with higher interbank interest rates that will remain at elevated levels for the foreseeable future, Xie added. China is also looking to further slow money supply growth in 2018 after it already slowed to the all-time low around 9 percent in November 2017.\nWith China likely headed toward a money supply growth rate of 7 to 8 percent in the next few years, it will be a \"very different situation\" for the economy, said Xie.\nshow chapters Chinese government has 'powerful' ability to fend off shocks: Credit Suisse 15 Hours Ago | 01:09 Meanwhile, concerns about debt will push the Chinese government to slow down on infrastructure growth, said Vincent Chan, Credit Suisse's head of China macro research.\nNonetheless, credit growth is still a big problem. But authorities are able to fence off the economy and financial systems from external and internal shocks, he said.\nAfter three decades of breakneck growth as a manufacturing powerhouse, China is transitioning to a services and consumer-led economy, but that will not be taking off in a big way until the government cuts taxes to promote the switch, said Xie.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T07:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T07:54:30.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Canada's public health agency, though, has said romaine lettuce is the source of its outbreak and advised its population to avoid consuming the leafy vegetable.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it is investigating illnesses in at least 13 states and indicated the outbreak started in mid-November and cases continued through Dec. 8 . One of the deaths from the outbreak was in California, according to a spokesman for the California Department of Public Health.\n\"Leafy greens tend to have little nooks and crannies where it's hard to wash off bacteria,\" said Jean Halloran, director of food policy initiatives at Consumers Union, the policy arm of Consumer Reports.\nAccording to Halloran, this appears to be the worst E. coli outbreak linked to leafy greens since 2006, when contaminated baby spinach sickened at least 205 people and killed three.\nE. coli can get on fresh produce by fecal contamination from wild animals, nearby livestock or even humans, say experts. The contamination can occur in the soil or water and happen on the farm itself or in the processing of the fresh produce.\nConsumer Reports recommends U.S. consumers temporarily steer clear of the romaine lettuce. But the CDC said it is still trying to determine the origin of the Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infections and hasn't issued any formal recommendation to stop eating romaine lettuce.\n\"We've been able to do some really detailed DNA fingerprinting of the bacteria and the outbreak in Canada and the outbreak in the United States,\" Matthew Wise, an epidemiologist and CDC response team leader, told CNBC on Friday.\nWise said the bacteria found on both sides of the border appear to be \"really closely related to one another.\" To be clear, though, he said more data needs to be collected in the U.S. to determine if romaine lettuce is the source of the domestic outbreak.\nHowever, some food industry veterans contacted for this story expressed frustration that more information hasn't been provided by the federal government and suggested the response has been perhaps slower than it should have been.\n\"We don't have any information beyond what the Canadian government and the CDC have put out,\" said Scott Horsfall, CEO of the California Leafy Greens Marketing Agreement (LGMA), a food-safety program formed a decade ago in the wake of the deadly spinach E. coli outbreak. \"It's pretty frustrating, actually. So we don't have any insights what may have happened.\"\nCDC's Wise defended the agency's handling and said, \"Canada has many more illnesses in their outbreak investigation. They have linked that to Romaine. We're working really hard to ... confirm whether or not that's the case also in the U.S.\"\nWise said the CDC is collaborating closely with the Canadian authorities \"on a weekly basis.\"\nMeantime, some industry experts said the shelf life of romaine lettuce is just a few days and so any contaminated product is probably long gone from supermarket shelves or restaurants.\n\"If this outbreak is actually confirmed to be caused by romaine lettuce, it's important to recognize this is a highly perishable product with limited usable shelf life and it's highly unlikely a specific affected lot would still be available for sale or in a home refrigerator,\" said Jon Dinsmore, a grower in Yuma, Arizona.\nTogether, California and Arizona grow about 90 percent of the leafy green vegetables produced domestically. Mexico also imports product into the United States.\nUnder the LGMA program, regular on-farm inspections are conducted and it certifies that grower or shipper members are in compliance with food-safety standards. There's a similar program operating in Arizona.\nThe 2006 spinach outbreak was linked to contamination from cattle fecal matter found near a California spinach farm, according to state and federal officials.\nAmong the other changes since 2006 are the Food Safety Modernization Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in January 2011. It is considered the most significant update to U.S. food safety rules since the 1930s.\nRegardless, some experts concede even tougher rules and self-policing programs by farmers and shippers probably won't ever eliminate the risk entirely.\n\"Anytime you have a raw agricultural product, they can get contaminated, and you can have these kind of outbreaks,\" said Bill Marler, a Seattle-based foodborne illness attorney.\nIn 2011, melons contaminated with listeria were blamed for sickening nearly 150 people, and 33 died as a result. Also, a U.S. Government Accountability Office report issued in November said there have been foodborne illnesses linked to other fresh produce, including cucumbers, alfalfa sprouts, bean sprouts and packaged salad products.\nMarler, though, does credit the Obama-era legislation with helping to bring some change.\nContamination \"is actually significantly less than what it was in the early part of the 2000s,\" he said. \"It used to be a fairly common occurrence where there would be literally hundreds of people sickened.\"\nEven so, the Trump administration has delayed some \"key\" portions of the food-safety overhaul from going into effect and is creating \"a gap\" in the farm-to-consumer \"safety chain,\" the Center for Science in the Public Interest charged Thursday.\nThe center also said the Trump administration is effectively \"undoing\" rules intended to protect consumers from being exposed to hazards such as E. coli or salmonella.\nCNBC reached out to the White House for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-06T02:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-06T02:41:51.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Prices peaked at $436.25, matching a level last seen on Dec. 5. \nCBOT March corn futures were up 2-1/4 cents at $3.53 a bushel. \nCBOT March soybeans were down 1 cent at $9.60-3/4 a bushel. \nSoybean losses were kept in check by ongoing concerns that heat in Argentina will limit the size of that country's harvest. \n\"While Argentina did receive good coverage over the past week, temperatures could top 100 degrees (Fahrenheit) (37.8 C) again in some areas by the end of the week before rains return,\" said Bryce Knorr, analyst at Farm Futures. \nShortfall in South American crop production could boost demand for U.S. exports and help alleviate the glut of domestic supplies following the recent bumper harvest. \nUSDA said on Tuesday morning that weekly U.S. soybean export inspections were 1.139 million tonnes, in line with forecasts for 1.1 million to 1.3 million tonnes. \nCorn export inspections were 683,898 tonnes, also in line with trade estimates that ranged from 575,000 to 800,000 tonnes.

Blockchain May Provide the Answer Courtesy: WWF By Jeff John Roberts 7:16 AM EST \nEco-conscious diners can rely on restaurants to tell them their fish comes from a sustainable source, but it can be hard to know for sure. \nThat’s why a new certification system, launched by blockchain company Viant and the World Wild Fund for Nature, is intriguing: It provides a step-by-step way to verify a fish’s journey from the ocean to the market to the dinner plate. \nThe new initiative, announced in late December, is the latest example of how blockchain technology—a type of software that creates a permanent, tamper proof ledger—can transform supply chains and preserve the integrity of the food supply. \nIn the case of sustainable fish, you can see the beginning of the process in the photo above. The picture shows a wild yellowfin tuna caught off the waters of Fiji, which has been tagged with a QR code supplied by Viant. \nThe code means the fish is ready to be be logged into Viant’s blockchain system, which will record its progress to Los Angeles and allow groups like the WWF and its partner SeaQuest to verify the harvest is from a sustainable fishery. \n“It’s immutable, verifiable proof that the yellowfin tuna you got in a restaurant was caught in Fiji, went through X distributor and arrived at the restaurant you’re now eating it today,” said Taylor Mulvihill, co-founder of Viant. \nMulvihill added it is up to the participants to decide what they want to upload to the blockchain and how they want to track the shipment. In the case of the tuna, for instance, the first recording to the blockchain could be a video of the fish being caught, while the distributors could use RFID instead of a QR code to access the ledger. \nAll of this is a reminder that, despite so much silly hype around blockchain right now—the restaurant chain Hooters’ effort to rebrand as a blockchain outfit is just the latest example—the technology is making real progress on the ground. \nIn the case of Viant, which built its Ethereum-based blockchain platform with the help of Microsoft Azure (msft) and the Brooklyn-based incubator ConsenSys, the fish tracking tool is just one use of its technology. \nViant is also providing its tracking services to pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline, which will use it to improve transparency in the licensing process, and to oil and gas companies. Mulvihill says Viant was operating in stealth during a year long trial period, but that all of its users are paying customers. \nViant is not the only one using blockchain technology to remake the supply chain process. Other notable examples include Walmart (wmt) and other retailers, which are using IBM’s Hyperledger Fabric (ibm) to improve food safety safety. \nThere are also promising niche cases.

That is only stored in users' mobiles, computers and other terminals,\" WeChat said in a post on the social media platform. \n\"WeChat will not use any content from user chats for big data analysis. Because of WeChat's technical model that does not store or analyse user chats, the rumor that 'we are watching your WeChat everyday' is pure misunderstanding.\" \nLi Shufu, chairman of Geely Holdings , owner of the Volvo car brand, was quoted in Chinese media on Monday as saying Tencent Chairman Ma Huateng \"must be watching all our WeChats every day\". \nLike all Chinese social media platforms, WeChat is required to censor public posts deemed \"illegal\" by the Communist Party. WeChat's privacy policy says it may need to retain and disclose users' information \"in response to a request by a government authority, law enforcement agency or similar body\". \nWeChat did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. \nAccording to a report by Amnesty International, Tencent ranked at the bottom of 11 tech firms running the world's most popular messenger apps for how they use encryption to protect user privacy. \nChina's cyber watchdog in September announced a new rule making chat group administrators and companies accountable for breaches of content rules. \nIn the same month it handed down maximum penalties to tech firms including Tencent, Baidu and Weibo Corp for failing to properly censor online content, and asked them to increase content auditing measures.

About a third of those will be in the state of Mato Grosso, where recently grain growers have relied more on the barter system to finance their crop. \nUnder barter, multinational commodities trading firms and agriculture product resellers supply inputs to farmers in exchange for securing future delivery of a portion of their crops. \nFor the first time since the 2008/2009 crop season, barter represented more than half of crop financing for producers in the state, according to Imea, a research agency based in Brazil's largest grain producing state. \n\"Barter is only used in Brazil,\" Aguiar said, adding the bank can offer loan options potentially more competitive to producers. \nState-run Banco do Brasil SA remains Brazil's largest rural credit provider, with about 66 percent of farm loans totaling 188 billion reais as of last October, according a ranking compiled by bank association Febraban.

While real estate and homebuilding stocks in Brazil performed well in 2017 on the front edge of a consumer-led turnaround, the numbers indicate real estate demand in Latin America's largest economy still has a way to go to recover. \nAccording to the study, residential real estate prices fell 0.53 percent in nominal terms in 2017. Considering annual inflation of 2.78 percent, prices fell 3.23 percent in real terms, FipeZap said. \nResidential markets performed much better in some cities than others.

With the settlement, it will pay out more than six times what it has received so far under a Brazilian probe into bribery schemes that involved company executives and government officials. \nThe settlement, smaller than many analysts anticipated, was an important milestone for the oil firm as it tries to emerge from the scandal that has entangled two former Brazilian presidents and dozens of the country's corporate executives. \nBut the deal reduces chances the world's most indebted oil company will pay a dividend for 2017, much anticipated by investors who have not seen such a payment since 2014 when the scandal came to light, a source familiar with the matter said. \nFor the last four years Brazil has been rocked by the so-called Car Wash investigation into kickbacks from contractors to executives of state-run companies and politicians in return for public projects. \nThe settlement put an end to \"extremely high uncertainty\" about the company's potential liability, JPMorgan said in a client note, adding that it had expected a figure above $5 billion. Analysts at Brazilian bank BTG Pactual said the market had expected a settlement of $5 billion to $10 billion. \nPetrobras preferred shares closed up nearly 0.91 percent to 16.70 reais. U.S.-traded shares rose 2.52 percent at $10.97. \nMoody's brushed off concerns about the impact of the fine on the company's balance sheet, noting it was expected to generate some $30 billion in cash this year and make capital investments of around $15 billion. \n\"Petrobras' liquidity position is adequate and the payment of the agreed class action settlement amount is not a material concern,\" it said. \n\"EXCELLENT RESULT\" \nJeremy Lieberman, an attorney for the investors, called the deal an \"excellent result\" and said it was the largest ever involving a foreign securities issuer in the United States. \nThe deal came as the U.S. Supreme Court was set to consider on Friday whether to hear Petrobras' appeal of a lower court decision certifying the case as a class action. Petrobras said it and the investors would ask the Supreme Court to put off considering the case while the settlement awaits approval. \nIf the Supreme Court does take the case, it could delay its resolution for years. \nU.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan must still approve the accord. \nInvestors had sued Petrobras after prosecutors in Brazil accused executives of accepting more than $2 billion in bribes over a decade, mainly from construction and engineering companies. \nIn a securities filing on Wednesday, Petrobras claimed it was a victim and denied wrongdoing, adding that it has only recovered 1.475 billion reais ($455.77 million) for itself from the Car Wash investigation. \nBut its market value has plunged as its central role in the scheme continues to be unwound by investigators. \nPetrobras said it hoped the settlement would resolve all investor claims in the United States where 13 individual lawsuits remain open, following settlements in 20 other cases. \nSome claims involving non-U.S.-based Petrobras securities purchased outside the United States also still remain. \nThe deal came days after Brazil's securities regulator CVM formally accused eight former Petrobras executives of corruption. \nThe accusations relate to possible irregularities in the contracting process for three drilling ships, according to a legal filing by the regulator last Friday. \nAmong the accused in CVM's filing are former Petrobras Chief Executives Maria das Gracas Foster and Jose Sergio Gabrielli. Neither could be reached for comment. \nThe largest securities fraud settlements in U.S. history include $7.2 billion stemming from the collapse of Enron, $6.2 billion over an accounting scandal at WorldCom and $3.2 billion over an accounting scandal at Tyco International, according to Stanford Law School's Securities Class Action Clearinghouse.

Despite the anticipated moderation, employment gains would still be above the monthly average of 170,000 over the past three months. \nHarsh weather in some parts of the country likely contributed to some of the job growth slowdown in December. \nFor all of 2017, the economy is expected to have created around 2 million jobs, slightly below the 2.2 million added in 2016. The Labor Department is due to release its closely watched employment report at 8:30 a.m. ET (1330 GMT) on Friday. \nJob growth surged in October and November after being held back in September by back-to-back hurricanes, which destroyed infrastructure and homes and temporarily dislocated some workers in Texas and Florida . A solid employment report would add to the upbeat assessment of the economy signaled in housing, consumer spending, and manufacturing data. \n\"Fed officials continue to look for signs that the U.S. economy remains on the expansion path, December's employment report should further support such an outlook,\" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. \"We believe the Fed will be in a position to raise rates in March.\" \nJob growth in line with expectations could heighten criticism of a $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump last month. \nThe fiscal stimulus, which includes a sharp reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, is occurring with the economy operating almost at capacity. There are concerns the economy could overheat. \n\"With the tax cuts we get solid GDP growth in the near-term and then a fiscal hangover, which will likely put the economy at a greater risk of recession,\" said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Job growth seen slowing \nEconomists expect job growth to slow this year as the labor market hits full employment, which will likely boost wage growth as employers compete for workers. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. \nAverage hourly earnings are expected to have risen 0.3 percent in December after gaining 0.2 percent in the prior month. So-called base effects are expected to, however, keep the annual increase in wages at 2.5 percent. Economists are optimistic that annual wage growth will top 3.0 percent by the end of this year. \nThe unemployment rate is forecast to be unchanged at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. With the December employment report, the Labor Department will incorporate annual revisions to the seasonally adjusted household survey data going back five years. \nThe unemployment rate is derived from the household survey, which means the series is likely to be revised. The jobless rate has declined by seven-tenths of a percentage point since last January. \nEconomists believe it could drop to 3.5 percent by the end of this year. That could potentially unleash a faster pace of wage growth and translate into a much stronger increase in inflation than currently anticipated. \nThat, according to economists, would force the Fed to push through four interest rate increases this year instead of the three it has penciled in. The U.S. central bank raised borrowing costs three times in 2017. \n\"If the unemployment rate declines and wages rise faster, which is likely, the Fed is going to start worrying about wage inflation,\" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. \nEmployment gains were likely broad in December, mirroring the pattern of the previous two months. Construction payrolls probably increased further, reflecting recent strong increases in homebuilding. \nAnother month of steady gains is expected in manufacturing employment. A strong holiday shopping season likely boosted retail payrolls in December. \nMacy's said last month it would hire an additional 7,000 temporary workers for its stores to deal with heavy customer traffic in the run-up to the holiday shopping season.

Most often, that means targeting health and wellness. A Google search analysis conducted last January showed that getting healthy was the most popular resolution , with more than 62 million searches, almost double the second-most-searched New Year's resolution: getting organized. \nThe ubiquity of smartphones in daily life makes it easier than ever to make a resolution related to health — sticking to it is something else. App tracker App Annie provided CNBC with data on the most popular free versions of health and wellness apps from 2017 based on both the Apple and Android app-store downloads. The data was through Dec. 28, 2017. \nAs technology giants such as Apple, Amazon and Google get serious about remaking the health-care sector , these results show how Americans are using their phones to take more control of their health, and the specific health issues that are proving to be most app-friendly. Fitbit is still No. 1, even if its stock price doesn't show it \nFitbit 's stock may be a dog — down roughly 20 percent in 2017 and now valued at about one-fifth of its post-IPO trading debut in 2015 — but the fitness-tracking device's app remains No. 1 in the health category among free downloads. And it's collected a lot of data — by its own count, 90 billion hours of heart-rate data, 85 trillion steps, 5.4 billion nights of sleep and 167 billion minutes of exercise. In its most recent results for the third quarter 2017, Fitbit reported sales of 3.6 million devices. While that level of device sales explains why it remains No. 1 on both Apple and Android app stores, its sales numbers have trended down in recent years, which explains the stock price. \nWhile the amount of data that can be collected is impressive — and will help medical researchers , including at the National Institutes of Health — a few prominent early studies investigating how much fitness trackers improve the health of users haven't provided glowing results. \nFitbit's latest product, the Ionic smartwatch that doubles as fitness tracker, faces the daunting task of beating out the Apple Watch . Amazon has been running a discount on the FitBit Ionic this week, timed to new health resolutions. Source: Amazon My Fitness Pal \nUnder Armour 's My Fitness Pal — which the sports apparel company bought in 2015 for $475 million — is No. 2 among free apps and UA touts a registered user base of 225 million-plus for this app plus others in its fitness app ecosystem, such as MapMyRun. The app allows users to count their calories for free. It includes more than 5 million foods in its database, considered the app world's largest, to help just about anyone track just about anything that they are eating, in calories. Users can complete other tasks related to weight loss, such as keeping a dieting journal and compiling healthy recipes. Source: Google Play Calm \nBeing named \"App of the Year\" by Apple helped this meditation and mindfulness app created by British tech entrepreneurs Michael Acton-Smith and Alex Tew reach No. 3 among free downloads. It was downloaded at a rate of up to 30,000 per day in 2017. The Calm app includes a Sleep Stories function, which offers users the opportunity to nod off to the voice of actor Stephen Fry. Acton Smith was previously known for the tech firm Mind Candy and the gaming success Moshi Monsters, which at one point half of all British children were playing, though that business has struggled more recently. \nCalm's success — investors thought it was \"weird,\" according to Acton Smith when it debuted in 2012 — comes amid a boom in meditation and sleep practices at companies including Salesforce and Arianna Huffington's Thrive Global , as Silicon Valley and corporate America now see these lifestyle choices as keys to productivity. Walmart's Jet online shopping business launched a Wellness Shop this week. \nWhile the Calm app is free, the company offers a premium subscription, and the app also is affiliated with other products, including a Calm book and Calm Sleep Mist. Calm Flo Period and Ovulation Tracker \nThe promise of artificial intelligence includes looking at many existing health-care issues in new ways. This app makes predictions of menstruation and ovulation using machine learning. The app is more than just a monthly countdown tool, though. It can be used for contraceptives and other pill planning; to track cycles and symptoms over time; integrate menstruation with lifestyle — sleep, hydration and exercise; and of course, help women trying to conceive. \nFlo Period may be among the most popular, at No. 4 in 2017, but it's far from the only app in this niche — the paid version of competing app Period Tracker is among the five most popular paid health downloads, according to App Annie. And there are also devices on the market specifically designed to work with apps for uses including fertility. The fertility business overall has boomed and is now valued in the billions of dollars and growing. Flo Period & Ovulation Tracker Headspace \nPlaying in the same niche as Calm, Headspace offers guided meditation sessions and mindfulness training. Its co-founder, Andy Puddicombe (pictured here leading a meditation class), has become a minor meditation celebrity: He is the author of multiple books under the Headspace brand, a Ted talker and even led the Tonight Show 's band The Roots through a two-minute meditation on-air in 2017. But his flair isn't as surprising when his degree in Circus Arts from the Conservatoire of Dance and Drama in London is considered. His pre-Headspace bio also included traveling to the Himalayas to study meditation after dropping out of school and 10 years later being ordained as a Tibetan Buddhist monk. \nAt No. 5 among all free downloads in the health niche, Headspace has also had success in the corporate arena. Companies that Headspace touts as users of its tool for productivity include Google, Airbnb, Spotify, LinkedIn, Aetna, Unilever and — in an industry that probably needs stress relief measures more than many — United Airlines.

Robert Huish and Patrick Balazo, researchers from Dalhousie University in Canada, have data that suggests the overabundance of ultra-nationalist Myanmar (Burmese) propaganda and anti-Rohingya hate speech on Facebook has played a lead role in the genocide. For complex reasons of cost and access, many people in Myanmar view Facebook as the internet. \"[T]his open information pipeline reinforces Facebook's dark side of self-reaffirmation with limited perspective,\" they say.

The total was well below the November pace of 252,000, which was revised up from the initially reported 228,000.\nAn unexpected loss of 20,000 retail positions during the holiday season held back the headline number. The unemployment rate for blacks fell to 6.8 percent, its lowest ever.\n\"A little bit of a disappointment when you only get 2,000 jobs out of the government and get retail at the absolute busiest time of the year losing 20,000 jobs. It just goes to show the true struggle that traditional brick and mortar is having now,\" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. \"Outside of that I actually thought it was a good report.\"\nBiggest gains came from health care (31,000), construction (30,000) and manufacturing (25,000). Bars and restaurants added 25,000, while professional and business services grew by 19,000.\nAverage hourly earnings rose modestly to the same 2.5 percent annualized gain as in November.\nFederal Reserve policymakers were watching the jobs data closely, both for payroll gains and for wage growth. Though central bank economists estimate the jobs market is near full employment, wage pressures have remained muted.\n\"I don't think it's that big of a deal,\" Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, said of the lower-than-expected number. \"I certainly don't think this has any impact in terms of what the Fed will do in the future. The economy continues to be on solid footing.\"\nIndeed, markets mostly shrugged off the jobs number. Stocks rose modestly in morning trade while government bond yields edged lower.\nMatthew Busch | Bloomberg | Getty Images Employees build components for hybrid electric vehicle motors at the Toshiba International manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas. Traders actually indicated a higher chance of a March Fed rate hike, pushing the probability from 68 percent before the report's release to 73 percent a half-hour later.\nAn alternative measure of unemployment that counts discouraged workers and those working part time for economic reasons edged higher to 8.1 percent. That came amid an unchanged labor force participation rate at 62.7 percent and a steady employment-to-population level of 60.1 percent, tied for the lowest since May.\nThe household survey, which calls homes to ask how many are at work, rose even less than the establishment survey, with 104,000 more Americans reported on the job.\nThe report comes amid buoyant expectations for growth overall. GDP rose 3.2 percent in the third quarter and 3.1 percent in the second quarter, and the Atlanta Fed projects the third quarter to register another 3.2 percent gain.\nIn addition, most retailers reported sharply higher holiday sales. Mastercard estimated growth at 4.9 percent for the 2017 holiday season from the same period a year earlier.\nThe pace of job growth came on the same month that Congress passed landmark tax legislation that took down the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and lowered rates for many Americans.\nNo less an authority than Warren Buffett is urging optimism, penning a column for Time magazine that cites the U.S. \"game of economic miracles\" that is only in its \"early innings.\"\nThe jobs report follows a stronger-than-expected reading on private-sector employment .

NRG Energy The S&P's biggest winner in 2017 was NRG Energy , a utility play that spent much of 2015 and 2016 in the doghouse due to mismanagement.\n\"But in 2017, NRG rose, Lazurus-like, and finally made it all the way back to where the stock was at the start of 2015\" thanks in part to an activist push to get the company back on its feet, Cramer said. \"It's up 132 percent, but I think the easy money's been made here. If I owned NRG, I'd be a seller — don't give back those gains.\"\n2. Align Technologies Cramer-fave Align Technology came in second for the S&P's winners, logging a 131 percent annual gain in 2017.\nEven though more bearish voices claim the market for Align's invisible teeth-straightening products is saturated, Cramer held on to his bullish thesis for the dentistry play.\n\"Align still has very little overseas penetration and very little competition,\" he said. \"Have a heart-to-heart with your dentist about this one. There just aren't enough cavities to go around to keep their businesses thriving anymore. But there are plenty of crooked teeth that need to be corrected before you Snap.\"\n3. Vertex Drugmaker Vertex was the third-best stock in the S&P for 2017 with a 103 percent annual gain. Cramer said the company's success with its cystic fibrosis treatment drove much of the move.\n\"There was plenty of skepticism about these guys and their clinical trials, but the drug came through and that should be huge for the company,\" he said. \"I bet there could be even more to come, even a possible takeover here, given how starved big pharma is for new drugs.\"\n4. Wynn Resorts Cramer likes when company insiders tell investors what to do with their stocks, like CEO Steve Wynn did with Wynn Resorts , the S&P's fourth-best winner in 2017.\nWynn bought his own company's stock when it was in the mid-$50s and $60s several years ago, betting that the hotel giant's Macau casino would far exceed performance expectations.\n\"He was right, and it helped boost the stock by 95 percent last year,\" Cramer said. \"I'm not deterred at all that Wynn Macau's numbers took a drop recently. I think that it can come roaring back. I think you'll regret dumping the stock.\"\n5. Boeing Boeing was the S&P's fifth-best stock and the Dow Jones industrial average's No. 1 winner. Cramer covered the aerospace colossus in-depth in a recent Dow stocks round-up .\n\"As much as I like most of the winners from the S&P, their moves seem a little more exaggerated and possibly more ephemeral than their counterparts in the Dow, especially Boeing,\" he said.\n6. Micron Commodity chipmaker Micron came in sixth for the S&P's top performers, but its stock has been treading water since the company's latest quarter, which beat analysts' expectations.\n\"That's not a good sign for a tech company because the action is telling you that something real bad may be lurking around the corner,\" Cramer said.\nPotential negatives for Micron include a peaking flash memory chip market and an upcoming peak in the market for DRAM chips, as well as potential overvaluation for Micron's shares, Cramer said.\n\"I think Micron's merely going to mark time after its stellar 88 percent gain last year,\" he said. \"I do prefer Nvidia or Broadcom .\"\n7. D.R. Horton For Cramer, the S&P's seventh-best performer was also one of the most surprising. Shares of homebuilder D.R. Horton ran 87 percent in 2017 despite some contradictory economic action.\n\"These are precisely the stocks that must be sold as soon as the Fed starts tightening ,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\nBut with mortgage rates not yet reflecting the Fed's latest interest rate hike , a housing shortage sweeping the country and the new tax code's passing igniting domestic stocks, D.R. Horton's gains can be justified, Cramer said.\n\"Finally, as the largest homebuilder by volume with a low price point for their houses, DR Horton's the ideal company for, yes, millennials, who at long last are moving out of expensive rental apartments or their parents' basements,\" Cramer added.\n8. PayPal PayPal , another Cramer-fave, took eighth place among the winners of the S&P, with shares also up 87 percent for 2017.\n\"I credit CEO Dan Schulman with much of the gain because he took PayPal from being a decent division of eBay into a company that's become the ultimate financial juggernaut, the millennial way to pay the bills,\" Cramer said.\n\"I think that the stock has more room to gallop, even after its incredibly strong start to 2018, because it hasn't even begun to monetize Venmo, the millennial way to split bills,\" he continued. \"If PayPal ever gives you a real pullback, I could see it being a takeover target.\"\n9. Nvidia Up 81 percent for 2017, Nvidia was the S&P's ninth-best stock, and Cramer said the chipmaker's top end-markets — gaming, cloud, artificial intelligence and data centers — aren't showing signs of slowing in 2018.\n\"But these same chips are used to mine bitcoin , and as long as it's linked to that cryptocurrency, Nvidia's going to have some weak-handed shareholders,\" Cramer said. \"Let's hope they were all shaken out by the recent morose behavior of this fabulous stock.\"\n10. PulteGroup Like D.R. Horton, homebuilder PulteGroup , tenth in the S&P's top brass, benefited from the shortage of cheap housing with a 81 percent annual gain.\n\"I think Pulte had too big a move versus what can happen now with the Fed's tightening.

The website showed that tron's latest gains gave the coin a market cap of $13.5 billion, greater than that of litecoin and just behind that of another coin, stellar.

VCG/Getty Images By Reuters Updated: January 4, 2018 12:03 AM ET \nChina’s ride-hailing application Didi Chuxing has agreed to acquire control of Brazil’s 99, the companies said in a statement on Wednesday, potentially creating a formidable rival to Uber in Latin America’s largest economy. \nThe companies did not disclose the stake acquired nor the value, but two people familiar with the deal told Reuters that the transaction would value 99 at over $1 billion and that Didi would hold a ‘significant majority’ of the Brazilian firm. \nThe Chinese company bought out investors such as Riverwood Capital, Monashees Inc, Qualcomm Ventures, Tiger Global Management LLC and SoftBank Group Corp, said one of the people. \nBrazilian newspaper Valor Econômico earlier reported the valuation of the deal and the investors involved. \nThe acquisition intensifies Didi’s global rivalry with Uber Technologies Inc, especially in Latin America. Reuters reported in December that Didi planned to enter Mexico this year. \nIt has previously partnered with overseas ride-hailing companies to offer reciprocal services in other countries, but Didi is now looking to launch its own services overseas. \nDidi’s Mexico entry represents the 4-year-old firm’s first move to deploy drivers under its own brand outside of China. \nCheng Wei, founder and chief executive of Didi, said in Wednesday’s statement that “globalization is a top strategic priority for Didi.” \nDidi first invested $100 million in 99 in January 2017, getting a stake and management rights in the Brazilian app. \n\nFor more on Uber, watch Fortune’s video: \nOne source with knowledge of the matter said the funds selling their stakes in 99 started looking for a buyer several months ago, in mid-2017. \nRiverwood, Monashees, Tiger Global, and SoftBank did not reply to requests for comment. \nDidi has made no secret of its desire to expand beyond China, particularly in light of the growing number of Chinese customers who travel overseas. \nThe firm sealed its dominance in the Chinese market after buying out Uber’s local China business in 2016, ending an expensive subsidy war that cost the U.S. firm roughly $2 billion. \nIn December, Didi raised $4 billion from investors, in part to fund global expansion, following on from a $5.5 billion fundraising in April.

If you're like me, you know that you're capable of doing unbelievable things this year. I believe that you can do it. But you'll need money, and lots of it, to reach your full potential.\nOnce you have some of that money, what steps should you take? Should you put, say, $5,000 in stocks, or in cryptocurrency?\nI get questions like this all the time. There are the two things I tell people:\n1. Spend money on yourself People don't create wealth because they never invest enough in a deal to get a big payoff. Significant wealth creators make big plays, not little ones. If you have a little bit of money, the only big play that you can make is to invest in yourself .\nSpend your money on developing new skills, gaining knowledge, and making powerful connections. You can never lose when you invest in yourself.\nWhat skills can you learn that will increase your ability to collect money from others?\nWhen I was 25, I spent my last $3,000 on an audio program and I can honestly say the investment and commitment to go \"all in\" are the reasons for my success today. Before that, I was addicted to drugs and obsessed with all the wrong things. One single investment changed the whole course of my life.\nDo you see how powerful investing in yourself can be? The sad truth is that most people don't take it seriously. Maybe you have a friend that talks about riches and glory but won't spend a few thousand dollars to learn a skill or make a connection that can make their dreams come true.\nHow does that make sense?\nCourtesy of Grant Cardone Self-made millionaire Grant Cardone. Those kinds of folks, if they do anything at all, look for opportunities to get rich quick without thinking of how to create wealth that can never be destroyed. Don't let that be you. Spend money on yourself so that you can get your income to massive levels.\nOnce your income is up , you'll be ready to start making investments in income-producing assets. Take your money and use it to become better. Add skills and your value will increase in the marketplace.\n2. Spend money on a sure thing After you spend money on gaining new skills, your income will skyrocket. You should put that money away in sacred accounts to prepare for future investments.\nSo, which investments? When it comes to investing, I'm a coward. Losing money terrifies me. One of my goals is to create indestructible wealth so, if anything ever happened to me, my family would never have to worry about the future. When I spend money, I think in terms of my long-term goals and legacy. That's why I don't risk losing my money.\nI only spend money on a sure thing — and real estate has been proven for many years to be the preferred investment of the 1 percent. Why? It produces income.\nIf you make the right investment real estate has proven it's a solid bet. Keep in mind, I don't invest in single-family homes. I go after monster deals that produce income. Just like I mentioned earlier, the same principle applies: Go after a big play. That means putting all your money in a great deal .\nshow chapters Self-made millionaire: Working too hard is not the cause of burnout      10:53 AM ET Thu, 23 Feb 2017 | 01:11 Most people don't go after a big enough deal for it to be worth it. They try to play it safe and small. That's not going to get you the results that you want.\nWhether you choose to invest in real estate or something else, look for income producing assets. That means cash flow. It's said that \"cash is king\" for a reason.\nWhen you're new to investing, I think you're ready to invest once you have saved up $100,000. It's an arbitrary number but, if you can do that, you've proven to yourself that you have enough discipline to make and keep money . Keep the money coming and put it away. Be smart — position yourself to get rich for sure by making big plays on sure things!\nBy spending money on myself and on sure things, I went from literally broke at 25 to on my way to becoming a billionaire at 59.\nGrant Cardone is a highly successful entrepreneur, New York Times best-selling author and sales training expert. \nLike this story?

That was the highest level since January 2012 and followed an upwardly revised $48.9 billion shortfall in October.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade deficit increasing to $49.5 billion in November after a previously reported $48.7 billion deficit in the prior month.\nPart of the rise in the trade deficit in November reflected price increases. When adjusted for inflation, the trade deficit rose to $66.7 billion from $65.6 billion in October. The so-called real trade deficit for October and November was above the third-quarter average of $62.0 billion.\nThat suggests trade will probably subtract from gross domestic product in the October-December quarter. The chronic trade deficit has garnered the attention of Republican President Donald Trump, who has blamed it for the massive loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs as well as moderate economic growth.\nThe government reported last month that trade contributed 0.36 percentage point to the economy's 3.2 percent annualized growth pace in the third quarter. The Trump administration believes that a smaller trade deficit, together with deep tax cuts, could boost annual economic growth to 3 percent on a sustained basis.\nImports of goods jumped to a record high of $204.0 billion in November. Capital goods imports were the highest on record. Imports of consumer goods rose to their highest level since March 2015. The strong growth in imports is being driven by robust consumer demand.\nThe country's import bill was also pushed up by imports of industrial supplies and materials, which were the highest since January 2015.\nImports from China were unchanged in November.

The semiconductor ETF ( SMH) has started the year off strong, rallying more than 3 percent since Tuesday and bouncing back to levels unseen since the end of November.\nGiven the move, Johnson believes that SMH will have to break the $101 region around which the 50-day moving average sits for the recent jump to be meaningful.\n\"For now, you have to stick with this SMH trade to the long side, but you have to be watching that 50-day moving average,\" he said.\nOn Wednesday, SMH was trading at $101.30, slightly above the 50-day moving average that Johnson said was key.\n\nChad Morganlander, a portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, remains overall bullish on the space and sees more upside ahead. He does, however, caution that there are fundamental factors that could derail the chip rally.\n\"In the long run, this ... is hypersensitive to global growth, so if you start to see any kind of deceleration of investment spending, you have to not be quite complacent with this one,\" he said on \"Power Lunch.\" \"But we think in [the first quarter], you're going to see an outperformance in relationship to the S&P 500.\"\nWhile Intel is one of the biggest components of SMH, the group as a whole continued to move higher on Wednesday as other names surged on the back of Intel's processor issues.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

What’s more, half of the deterioration in sales was attributable to drops in music and DVDs, two categories that have been in a long decline across the industry but remained fixtures at Barnes & Noble. \nAnd in yet more evidence of how much difficult Barnes & Noble is having carving out a niche for itself in the current environment, its online sales fell 4.5%, making it a rare retailer to see its e-commerce business contract. All this comes at a time arch-rival Amazon.com amzn has been opening more bookstores. \nThe company said in November it would exit some gift and toy products , gradually shrink its store size and focus more on books. But even there, Barnes & Noble, the top U.S. bookstore chain with 632 stores, is struggling: its book sales fell 4.5%, underperforming the overall book market. \nBarnes & Noble said in a press release it “remains focused on executing its strategic turnaround plan,” which includes cost cuts. That plan includes some test stores with cafes and that sell alcohol that are showing promising results but that frankly are too few in number to move the needle anytime soon. \nChief Executive Demos Parneros, who took the reins last year after multiple changes in the corner office in recent years, has been making small modest moves so far. They include things like giving customers who bought a book a coupon to get a discount on a coffee at its café. Another is to encourage its booksellers to engage with customers, something that should go without saying for a bookstore if it wants to give customers a reason to go to its stores. \nBut none of this is so far adding up to a cohesive strategy to pull Barnes & Noble out of its long downward spiral, now up to seven quarters of comparable sales declines, at a time shoppers are increasingly learning to look elsewhere for their book buying needs.

This advertising campaign should be seen for what it is: an effort to divert attention from the fact that PMI remains a primary cause of the smoking problem, not the solution.\nNot surprisingly, PMI set no deadline for actually giving up cigarettes. If the company is truly committed to a smoke-free future, it should actively support the proven policies to reduce smoking that are endorsed by an international public health treaty, the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. These include significant tobacco tax increases, comprehensive smoke-free laws, tobacco advertising bans, and graphic health warnings on cigarette packs. These policies apply equally to all tobacco companies, and supporting them would not put PMI at a competitive disadvantage.\nInstead, the company has led the fight against these policies around the world. A 2017 investigative report by Reuters revealed a massive, secret PMI campaign aimed at \"bringing to heel the world's tobacco control treaty.\" From Australia to Uruguay to Thailand, the corporation has filed expensive lawsuits that challenge strong tobacco control laws and seek to intimidate other countries into inaction.\nIn the same breath that it talks of a smoke-free future, PMI brags that Marlboro is \" the number one global cigarette brand .\" Across the globe, Philip Morris promotes its cigarettes in ways that appeal to kids , introducing flavored cigarettes, conducting aggressive marketing near elementary schools, and sponsoring race cars and concerts . In 2016, a senior company executive touted PMI's efforts to \" develop untapped markets \" for cigarettes across Africa and the Middle East. That doesn't sound like a company that wants a smoke-free future.\nStacks of cigarettes stand at the Philip Morris International (PMI) Coltabaco SAS production facility in Medellin, Colombia, on Friday, June 2, 2017. Philip Morris International produced 14.7 percent of the world’s 6 trillion cigarettes in 2015, behind only state-controlled China National Tobacco Corp.’s 44 percent, according to Euromonitor data. Photographer: Nicolo Filippo Rosso/Bloomberg via Getty Images Nicolo Filippo Rosso/Bloomberg via Getty Images In its UK ad, PMI claims, \"No cigarette company has done anything like this before.\" In fact, this is not the first time a tobacco company has claimed to fund \"independent research\" and pledged to solve the smoking problem. PMI itself did so in September, when it created its Foundation for a Smoke-Free World . Instead of advancing public health, tobacco companies have used such research to divert attention from real solutions and their own harmful actions.\nTobacco companies also have a long history of introducing supposedly safer products that turned out to be no safer at all, most notoriously their fraudulent promotion of light and low-tar cigarettes.\nThis is also not the first time Philip Morris has claimed that it would get out of the cigarette business. In 1954, a Philip Morris vice president stated, \"[I]f we had any thought or knowledge that in any way we were selling a product harmful to our customers, we would stop business tomorrow .\" Yet tobacco industry scientists knew at the time that cigarettes were dangerous to health. In 1997, Philip Morris's CEO said in a deposition that the company would \"shut [production] down instantly\" if presented with evidence that smoking causes lung cancer. But that evidence had already been presented in a surgeon general report released more than 30 years earlier.\nPMI's latest claims are no more credible. Until the company stops marketing cigarettes and fighting efforts to reduce smoking, its claimed commitment to a smoke-free future should be seen as another public relations stunt, not a serious effort to reduce the death and disease caused by its products.\nMatthew L.

The most-active contract peaked at $4.41-1/2, its highest since Nov. 22. \nCBOT March soft red winter wheat futures were 2 cents higher at $4.35-1/2 a bushel. \nThe U.S. Agriculture Department said on Tuesday afternoon that winter wheat in Kansas, the top production state for the grain, was rated 37 percent good to excellent, down from 51 percent at the end of November. A year ago, the state's winter wheat crop was rated 44 percent good to excellent. \nCBOT March corn futures were down 1/4 cent at $3.53 a bushel. Prices firmed early but weakened after failing to break through the 50-day moving average. \nCBOT March soybean futures were 2-1/2 cents higher at $9.67-1/4 a bushel. \nArgentina's bread-basket province of Buenos Aires will remain mostly dry in the days ahead, meteorologists said on Tuesday, after reporting scant rain over the weekend.

There's not going to be anything coming off the Illinois River for a couple of weeks,\" said a grain barge trader who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to media. \nSoybean barges loaded in January and delivered to the Gulf traded as high as 50 cents over Chicago Board of Trade March futures, the highest since late September. January corn barges traded at 47 cents above CBOT March futures, a 10-month high. \nCME Group Inc, which owns the CBOT, said it is monitoring the icy conditions on the river, where its approved delivery stations are located. The exchange's January soybean contract is currently in delivery. \n\"At present the majority of regular shipping stations are able to make/take deliveries,\" spokesman Chris Grams said in an email. \nWHEAT RALLY CONTINUES \nBenchmark HRW wheat prices on the Chicago Board of Trade on Wednesday climbed to the highest since Nov. 22 on worries over deteriorating crop conditions. \nTemperatures in central and southwest Kansas, eastern Colorado and northern Oklahoma were low enough for long enough on Monday to damage or kill some dormant hard red winter (HRW) wheat, which is milled for flour to make bread and pizza crust. \nHow broad the damage was will not be clear until the crop breaks dormancy in late winter or spring. \nCrop conditions in Kansas, the top HRW producer, are already deteriorating. The U.S. Department of Agriculture rated just 37 percent of the crop in good to excellent condition at the end of December, down from 51 percent a month earlier. \nColder air across the U.S. Plains lifted benchmark CME live cattle futures to a seven-week high late last week as beef packers rushed to secure livestock. Prices are expected to ramp higher this week as frigid weather may slow weight gains in cattle and make it difficult to sort and load livestock - which limits their availability to processors. \n\"Late last week and this week on the cattle market there has been some difficulties in transporting animals and even meat in some areas of the Plains, Upper Midwest and in the Eastern United States,\" said Colorado-based Livestock Marketing Information Center Director Jim Robb. \n(Reporting by Karl Plume in Chicago; Additional reporting by Theopolis Waters in Chicago; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T03:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T22:27:49.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The common thread?\n\"Tax reform. That's right, the very event that was supposedly baked into the [market], that all the graybeards ... said was being overblown, is proving to be the main reason for most of these positive analyst reports and upgrades,\" Cramer said.\nThe sudden change of heart made Cramer wonder why so many commentators told investors to stay out of the market because of the tax plan's effect on stocks.\n\"Frankly, I am outraged about this,\" he said. \"I've been adamant that the surprise of tax reform — and come on, hardly anyone thought this bill could even pass as late as November — occurred so quickly that the analysts didn't even have a chance to revise their estimates.\"\nNow, analysts are anointing a host of U.S.-based, high-taxpaying companies including Ulta Beauty , Dave & Buster's , Dick's Sporting Goods , General Mills and Waste Management all because of the tax plan's passage.\n\"You know what? I think these are all buys, every one of them,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\nHere's how Cramer sees it: Ulta's spent enough time in the doghouse to start making a comeback; Dave & Buster's \"experiential\" positioning gives it plenty of room to expand; Dick's Sporting Goods can stand to rise with Nike and Under Armour falling back into favor; and General Mills deserved an upgrade after a better-than-expected quarter .\nAs for Waste Management, which caught a price target raise from Macquarie's research arm on Wednesday, Cramer said the company was poised for success as it tackled the post-hurricane cleanup in Texas and Florida.\n\"Can the stock actually hit $114?\" Cramer wondered, referencing Macquarie's target price. \"Hey, it's only at $87, but at this pace, other analysts will have to raise their price targets and the whole process will start all over again.\"\nAnd as heated as the \"Mad Money\" host was about the recommendations, he couldn't deny that they were boosting the corresponding stocks.\nCramer recalled his time working at a major research firm, when research directors demanded for analysts to come up with buys for the following day.\n\"It's been 16 years since I've seen so many recommendations that actually move stocks, move 'em big. Believe me when I tell you it's contagious,\" he said.\nWith the market gearing up for another earnings season, Cramer wanted investors to be mindful of this dynamic and to keep a close eye on analyst reports.\n\"The analysts are under pressure from their research directors to pound the table,\" he said. \"They want to get ahead of when the companies themselves take their estimates up. And guess what? This was day one of the process. Baked in? I think it's just getting started.\"\nWATCH: Cramer (literally) slams \"baked in\" commentary on taxes show chapters Cramer: Analyst recommendations are already boosting stocks in 2018—and they won't stop 20 Hours Ago | 12:48 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Waste Management.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T01:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-04T01:19:13.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The anticipation is that new capital depreciation rules will increase investment budgets and, by extension, lending.\nBut bear in mind: The success of the bank trade will ultimately depend upon the rule of 3 in 2018. Will the Fed raise rates three times? Will gross domestic product grow at a rate of 3 percent?\nIf both of those assumptions fail, then bank stocks could see a nasty correction as the yield curve continues flattening and threaten the lending institutions' profit margins.\nOf two of the banks reporting earnings next week, J.P. Morgan enjoys a much better reputation and a more dominant market position than Wells Fargo, so investors wary of any correction in the sector may want to consider a pair trade.\nBy going long an equal amount of J.P.

He has been relentless in his advocacy for his father and the agenda that has helped turn our country around,” Bannon said in a statement released on Sunday, adding that his comments were directed at Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager, and not aimed at the president’s son. \n“I regret that my delay in responding to the inaccurate reporting regarding Don Jr. has diverted attention from the president’s historical accomplishments in the first year of his presidency,” Bannon said.

While it's hard to predict exactly what corporate America will do, some provisions in the new tax law could have a fairly direct impact on workers.\nAlso worth noting: While no changes were made specifically to the tax treatment of employer-provided health insurance, as of 2019, there is no longer a tax penalty if you do not have coverage.\nHere's how some of the changes in the new tax law affect employees, starting with the positives.\nBonuses, more pay One of the most immediate results of the tax bill's passage on Dec. 20 was a flurry of announcements from large U.S. companies that they would share their windfall with employees. For example, JetBlue Airways , Bank of America and CNBC parent company Comcast announced they would award certain workers a special bonus of $1,000.\nOther companies, such as banks BB&T and Fifth Third , said that in addition to giving one-time bonuses, they are increasing their minimum hourly pay rate.\nSince those first announcements, many other companies have followed suit. According to an aggregated list by Americans for Tax Reform, dozens of other small and large companies have announced bonuses — ranging from a few hundred dollars to $3,000 — or increases to their hourly pay rates due at least in part to passage of the tax legislation.\nshow chapters Rep. Rob Portman: Businesses can now be competitive after GOP tax reform 9:05 AM ET Thu, 4 Jan 2018 | 03:14 And of course, many workers will see fatter paychecks due to lower tax rates on individuals.\nOnce companies have a chance to incorporate the new tax brackets and withholding rates into their systems, paychecks will reflect the new rates. The tax law retained seven income brackets, but lowered the tax rates applied to each bracket and modified some of the income levels.\n\"The new tax withholdings rates should be ready by the end of January and affect employee paychecks by March,\" said Greg Long, public policy leader at benefits administrator Alight Solutions.\nShort-term leave The Family and Medical Leave Act is a federal law that guarantees employees at larger companies up to 12 weeks of leave each year, although employers do not need to pay workers for that leave. The new tax law provides a partial tax credit to employers who offer wages during those times.\n\"It's an incentive for employers to offer paid time off,\" said Karen Frost, vice president of health strategy and solutions at Alight. \"We could see employers moving in the direction of offering some pay during those family leaves as a result of the tax change.\"\n\"We could see employers moving in the direction of offering some pay during those family leaves as a result of the tax change.\" -Karen Frost, Alight Solutions 401(k) loans Workers who have an outstanding loan from their 401(k) account when they leave their employer also get some relief.\nGenerally speaking, when you leave your job — voluntarily or otherwise — and still owe money on a loan from your 401(k) account, your employer will give you a short window to repay it. If you do not, the amount gets deducted from your account balance. In other words, you pay off that loan whether you want to or not.\nHowever, pre-2018, if you rolled over your remaining 401(k) balance to an IRA or another employer plan, you would be taxed on the loan balance unless you could come up with that amount to contribute to your rollover account within 60 days. In other words, the loan balance had been treated as a taxable distribution at that time and potentially subject to a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty.\n\"When you're in between jobs it's hard to come up with the money to pay [a loan] back. Now you'll have more time to come up with it.\" -Greg Long, Public policy leader at Alight Solutions Now, you get until your tax-due date (typically April 15) of the following year to put that loan amount into your rollover account without it getting treated as a distribution.\n\"When you're in between jobs it's hard to come up with the money to pay it back,\" Long said. \"Now you'll have more time to come up with it.\"\nThe new tax law also eliminates some deductions available to employees or employers, and makes other changes that could affect employee benefits. Here are some of them.\nMoving expenses When an employer paid for a worker's moving expenses due to a new job or relocation, the amount was not taxable to the employee. The new law suspends that tax-free treatment through 2025, which means it will be considered income to the employee and taxed as such. The exception to this rule is for active-duty military members.\nTheoretically, Long said, an employer that pays for a move could increase the employee's gross pay to reflect the taxable moving expenses.\n\"It's too early to know if employers will change their policies because of this,\" Long said.\nEmployee awards In the tax legislation, lawmakers included a definition of what can be given as tax-free achievement awards. While not intended to mark a change in the law, it does codify what can and cannot be excluded from an employee's income.\nIn simple terms, if you are given cash or a cash equivalent, such as a gift card, meals, lodging or tickets, they are taxable.

People are even mortgaging their homes to pour money into the cryptocurrency that started out 2017 being worth $1,000. By Nov. 20 the price of Bitcoin had set a new record, passing the $8,000 mark . On the last day of the year, the value of Bitcoin was $14,129 per coin. \nPerhaps you too want to invest in Bitcoin—but you’re not really sure how. Here’s a guide. \nTo be clear, this is not an endorsement for any cryptocurrency, Bitcoin , Ethereum, Ripple or otherwise. It’s also not a suggestion that you should invest in cryptocurrency at all. Here’s what we do know: The markets for these largely untested, unproven digital assets are like teenagers—young and unpredictable. Just look at the volatile ride Bitcoin was on over the Christmas holiday . \nFirst, some context. (Want to get right to the buying? Scroll down to the section “How Do I Buy Bitcoins?”) What Is Bitcoin? \nBitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that can be bought, sold, or traded like a commodity. It can also be used to buy goods—pizza, cars, beer, whatever you’d like. \nBitcoin is different from U.S. dollars because it uses peer-to-peer technology to operate. That means there is no central authority—in this example, the U.S. Treasury—to issue new money or track transactions. Those functions are built into Bitcoin itself—specifically, the so-called blockchain technology that powers Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies—which is one reason it’s such an attractive, and controversial, concept. \nWhat is the blockchain , you ask? Think of it like a digital version of a public ledger, in which all transactions are recorded for everyone to see. It serves as the primary mechanism for trust in this financial system. \nThe term “cryptocurrency,” by the way, applies to any digital currency that uses cryptography to make secure transactions between two people instantly anywhere in the world. Created in 2009, Bitcoin is the oldest cryptocurrency. Other cryptocurrencies have since emerged, including Ripple and Ethereum. \nBitcoins, which are also called BTC for short, are the units of currency of the Bitcoin system. How Is Bitcoin Generated? \nBitcoins are created or generated by the network as a reward for the “mining” process, a computational effort in which blockchain—that is, public ledger—transactions are verified. \nThe details of this democratic process are complicated. It involves mathematical problems of varying difficulty, software to solve them, and a schedule that ensures that solutions are discovered on a highly regulated basis. All you need to know is that every time a mathematical solution is found, a new “block” on the chain is created. Blocks cannot be removed or altered once they’ve been accepted by the network. \nThe Bitcoin system allows six blocks to be mined every hour. Because it gets more difficult over time, the system is expected to generate fewer Bitcoins over time. (It is structured such that, for every four years the network is in operation, half the amount of Bitcoins that were created in the previous four years are generated.) The bitcoin supply is capped at just under 21 million coins. More than 16.7 million coins have been mined as of Dec. 30, 2017. So How Do I Buy Bitcoins? \nYou can buy Bitcoins directly from other people using online marketplaces, no different than any other product or service. Alternately, you can also use a digital currency exchange or broker such as Coinbase , Bitstamp , Kraken , and Gatehub . Coinbase is one of the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges. For a beginner, it’s best and easiest to use one of these exchanges. \nYou’ll also need a “wallet,” a place to store the digital currency. (You’ll need one of these no matter which exchange you might use.) The wallet stores your private key, a secret number—a 256-bit string—that gives you access to your Bitcoins. Your private key also allows you the freedom to move across marketplaces. Just because you purchased Bitcoin on a particular exchange doesn’t mean you have to stick with it; your private key ensures that you can always access your wallet, whichever marketplace you use. \nThere different kinds of wallets, including software and hardware wallets. Software wallets are in essence applications, or apps, that you connect with your traditional bank account. There are several to choose from: Coinbase offers a wallet, which is convenient because it is tied directly to its exchange service. There is also Mycelium , a popular mobile wallet, as well as Electrum . Meanwhile hardware wallets store the user’s private keys on a secure hardware device that looks a lot like a flash memory stick. Hardware wallets are considered by some people to be more secure because they can disconnect from the Internet. (There have been cases of hackers stealing Bitcoin from Internet-connected computers . Worried? Here’s how to avoid bitcoin theft .) \nPicked your wallet and your marketplace of choice? Good. Now that you have all the ingredients ready, here’s how to complete the recipe. \nStep one. Create your wallet. The easiest way to do this is through a third-party like Coinbase , Exodus, MyCelium, or blockchain.info . Go to the site of the wallet provider you’ve chosen and sign up. This step requires name, email address, and password. \nStep Two. If you’ve chosen a software wallet, you will be asked to download the app. Download it through the Apple app store or Google Play, depending on whether you have the iOS or Android operating system. Some wallets are designed for desktops; others are better for mobile devices. \nStep Three. Visit the exchange you’ve picked out. Maybe it’s Coinbase, Poloniex , CEX.io, Kraken, Bitfinex, BitPanda, or BitStamp. Register with the exchange. Again, you’ll need your name, email address, password. Most exchanges require you to connect with your bank account to pay for your Bitcoin purchase. \nSome exchanges like Coinbase offer an app that acts as an exchange and a wallet. Through the app, you can both buy and trade Bitcoins as well as store them. That’s fine, but remember that just because you use the Coinbase exchange doesn’t mean you have to use the Coinbase digital wallet. There are many other digital wallets out there. (And exchanges, for that matter.) \nStep four : Go to the exchange’s “buy” section. Select the amount of bitcoin you want to buy. Given the recent high price of Bitcoin, you can buy less than one Bitcoin on these exchanges. Bitcoin can be divided up to eight decimal points. This means you can buy 0.5 Bitcoins, 0.02 Bitcoins, or even 0. 1 Bitcoin, if it suits your budget. Depending on the exchange, you can buy Bitcoins with a credit card, bank transfer, or even cash. \nHappy Bitcoin trading!

The analysis also found that both stocks have traded positive 80 percent and 100 percent, respectively, in that time period. \nOther stocks that have kept investors warm during the cold winter include Home Depot, Domino's Pizza and Autozone .

Here's what to buy if it gets really cold \nCNBC found that some travel and retail stocks tend to outperform the market when the U.S. is hit by cold wave, which is a rapid fall in temperature during a 24-hour period. \nPriceline shares have gained an average of 9.1 percent one month after an official cold wave (as determined by the National Weather Service) strikes since 1997, while Royal Caribbean climb an 7.9 percent. The cold weather likely gets people to travel to warmer locales or at least start planning to do so. \nOther stocks that perform well following such weather events are Target and Macy's. Target's average return after a cold wave is 6.6 percent, while Macy's averages a return of 6.3 percent. Warm winters could hurt department stores by leaving a lot of cold weather clothes inventory on the books. The S&P 500 meanwhile, has averaged a return of 2.2 percent in these instances dating back to 1997. \nNatural gas stocks, meanwhile, have lagged the market after a cold wave hits the U.S. \nShares of Concho Resources has averaged a decline of 15.2 percent after the last five cold waves dating back to 1997. Newfield Exploration, Chesapeake Energy, and Transocean have also averaged declines of more than 10 percent. Anadarko Petroleum shares, meanwhile, have fallen an average of 9 percent, according to Kensho. \nWhen there is frigid weather, sometimes natural gas companies are forced to close down their wells. \nDisclosure: NBCUniversal, parent of CNBC, is a minority investor in Kensho. \n—CNBC's Dominic Chu and Gina Francolla contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-03T23:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-03T23:36:02.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

In some countries, Epiphany and not Christmas, is the holiday occasion to exchange gifts among loved ones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-06T14:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-06T15:04:48.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Analysts at Brazilian bank BTG Pactual said the market had expected a settlement of $5 billion to $10 billion. \nPetrobras preferred shares ticked up nearly 1 percent to 16.71 reais. U.S.-traded shares were up 1.78 percent at $10.89. \nMoody's brushed off concerns about the impact of the fine on the company's balance sheet, noting it was expected to generate some $30 billion in cash this year and make capital investments of around $15 billion. \n\"Petrobras' liquidity position is adequate and the payment of the agreed class action settlement amount is not a material concern,\" it said. \nJeremy Lieberman, an attorney for the investors, called the deal an \"excellent result\" and said it was the largest ever involving a foreign securities issuer in the country. \nThe deal came as the U.S. Supreme Court was set to consider on Jan. 5 whether to hear Petrobras' appeal of a lower court decision certifying the case as a class action. Petrobras said it and the investors would ask the Supreme Court to put off considering the case while the settlement awaits approval. \nIf the Supreme Court does take the case, it could delay its resolution for years. \nU.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan must still approve the accord. \nInvestors had sued Petrobras after prosecutors in Brazil accused executives of accepting more than $2 billion in bribes over a decade, mainly from construction and engineering companies. \nPetrobras claimed it was a victim, and denied wrongdoing in a securities filing on Wednesday. But its market value has plunged as its central role in the scheme continues to be unwound by investigators. \nPetrobras said it hoped the settlement would resolve all investor claims in the United States, though some claims involving non-U.S.-based Petrobras securities purchased outside the United States still remain. \nThe deal came days after Brazil's securities regulator CVM formally accused eight former Petrobras executives of corruption. \nThe accusations relate to possible irregularities in the contracting process for three drilling ships, according to a legal filing by the regulator last Friday. \nAmong the accused in CVM's filing are former Petrobras Chief Executives Maria das Gracas Foster and Jose Sergio Gabrielli. Neither could be reached for comment. \nThe largest securities fraud settlements in U.S. history include $7.2 billion stemming from the collapse of Enron, $6.2 billion over an accounting scandal at WorldCom and $3.2 billion over an accounting scandal at Tyco International, according to Stanford Law School's Securities Class Action Clearinghouse.

Golden Globes proves test for Hollywood sex scandal Jill Serjeant 4 Min Read \nLOS ANGELES, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The red carpet is rolling out, the champagne is on ice and the statuettes are about to be handed over. \nBut with the cloud of sexual harassment hanging over Hollywood’s annual round of self-congratulations, the Golden Globe ceremony on Sunday marks the first test of how the industry will handle live on the world’s stage a scandal that has rocked show business. \n“This is an issue that is center stage in Hollywood and is playing out at the award shows,” said Tom O‘Neil, founder of awards website GoldDerby.com. \nCelebrities and filmmakers who were once major players during awards season have been shunned, written out of shows or snubbed in nominations. \nWomen are planning to wear black on the Golden Globes red carpet to signal support of sexual harassment victims; a major talent agency has canceled its annual Golden Globes party to instead fund legal defense for victims; and the Screen Actors Guild Awards later in January will feature all female presenters. \nThe mood ahead of the Oscars on March 4 ranges from nervousness to eagerness to take a stand. \n“Everyone I have been talking to is relishing the opportunity to make this kind of visibility and attention more meaningful than simply about the glorification of a single profession,” actress Michelle Williams, who is Golden Globe nominated for “All the Money in the World,” told Reuters. \nMore than 30 men have accused Kevin Spacey of sexual misconduct and more than 70 women have made allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein. \nDustin Hoffman, comedian Louis C.K. and Jeffrey Tambor are among dozens of other celebrities, politicians and businessmen who have been accused of sexual impropriety. \nReuters is unable to independently verify any of the accusations. Weinstein has denied having any non-consensual sex with anyone, Spacey apologized to one of his accusers but was erased from “All the Money in the World” and written out of his TV series “House of Cards.” \nHoffman and Tambor have denied any wrongdoing. C.K. admitted past misconduct and his movie and TV projects have been dropped. \n“I always saw this awards season as a perfect little bubble where everything is magical and beautiful because it’s movies. I think what we’re realizing now is that it has its own issues that it has to work on,” Emily Gordon, screenwriter for movie “The Big Sick,” told Reuters \nOn Sunday, all eyes will be on Golden Globes host Seth Meyers and how he navigates what is traditionally a boozy celebration and the elephant in the room. \n“He’s got an impossible job. He can’t ignore the hot button issue in Hollywood. He’s expected to lead a jokathon but it’s not a laughing matter,” said O‘Neil. \nHollywood is also at odds with itself. Matt Damon was slammed in December for suggesting that allegations of rape and inappropriate touching should not be conflated. Talk show host James Corden was criticized for joking about Weinstein at a Beverly Hills event in October, and Rose McGowan accused Meryl Streep of remaining silent about Weinstein’s alleged behavior. Streep denied the accusation and called for women to unite. \n“This is getting to be a whole internecine battle in Hollywood. I think they are all very nervous,” said Pete Hammond, awards columnist for Deadline.com. \nThe Golden Globe awards for film and television will be televised live from Beverly Hills on NBC on Sunday Jan. 7, starting at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT (0100 GMT on Monday).

Adalberto Roque—AFP/Getty Images By Reuters 9:40 PM EST \nThe European Union’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, arrived in Cuba on Wednesday to help strengthen member countries’ economic and political ties with the Communist-run island. \nMogherini’s visit “reconfirms the strong EU-Cuban relationship,” and she will press for an “ambitious and swift joint implementation of the Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement,” the EU said in a statement. \nAs the U.S.-Cuba rapprochement unfolded in 2015-2016 the EU dropped all sanctions and negotiated the agreement, the first accord between Cuba and the 28-nation bloc. \nSigned in December 2016 and ratified in November, the EU said at the time that it hoped to position its companies for Cuba’s transition to a more open economy and allow the EU to press for political freedoms on the island. \n“I was here visiting just a few days before the visit of President Obama, and I remember at the time there was much talk about Cuba strengthening relations with both the European Union and the United States,” Mogherini said, when asked by reporters about the Trump administration’s partial rollback of a fragile detente between the old Cold War foes. \nFor more on President Trump’s Cuba policy, watch Fortune’s video: \n“Regardless of the changes in policy in Washington, the message I am bringing here is that the friendship and relationship with the EU is here to stay. It’s solid, it’s stable and it’s reliable,” she said. \nMogherini’s first official meeting on the two-day visit was with Foreign Investment and Cooperation Minister Rodrigo Malmierca. \nShe was also scheduled to meet with the head of the Roman Catholic Church, Archbishop Giorgio Lingua, and Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez on Thursday. \n“Cuba’s weak economy has been battered by the collapse in Venezuela, making it more vulnerable and open to foreign capital. Europe is seizing the moment,” said economist Andrew Zimbalist, a Cuba expert at Smith College in the United States. \nCuba faces a host of challenges, including declining aid from socialist ally Venezuela. Last month Cuba extended the term of its current leadership to April, signaling a two-month delay in the historic handover from Raul Castro to a new president, while announcing tighter regulations on the non-state sector. \nThe official Juventud Rebelde newspaper reported on Wednesday that the EU is the most important exporter and second trading partner of Cuba, and also the most important donor of cooperation and foreign investment.

Two major policy interests under consideration are another go at health care reform or big cuts to entitlements and welfare, Axios reports . \nThe main question may center on the use of “reconciliation” in the U.S. Senate. This procedural tool would allow the chamber to pass certain kinds of legislation which affects the federal budget—including spending on programs like Obamacare, Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, and Social Security—with a simple majority. (This is the same method that the Senate used to pass the GOP tax bill at the end of last year.) \nBut Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is reportedly at odds with GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan on whether or not to use reconciliation and pass another major bill without any Democratic votes. McConnell has voiced support for more bipartisan collaboration on significant legislation in 2018; Ryan and other House conservatives have urged a more combative approach. \nReconciliation’s tactical appeal in the Senate is clear. The GOP holds just a one-seat majority in the chamber after the surprise victory of Democrat Doug Jones in last year’s Alabama special election; that means they can lose just one Republican vote, even under reconciliation (Vice President Mike Pence would cast a tie-breaker in the case of a 50-50 split). \nBut the politics are more complicated. For one, reconciliation is a budgetary vehicle, and passing a budget is no mean feat given the intra-party disagreements among Republicans. And McConnell and his fellow GOP Senators may not be excited at the prospect of passing deeply unpopular cuts to popular programs like Medicaid, Medicare, and welfare on a party-line vote immediately after passing a deeply unpopular tax bill on a party-line vote. A bipartisan approach to reforming entitlements could, politically at least, help spread the blame around. Trump’s opinion may shape the path forward given the disagreements between McConnell and Ryan.

He was raised there, went to college at San Jose State University to study computer science, then dropped out and—to the puzzlement of some friends—came home. Since then, he has become the acting director of Kern Innovation and Technology Community, an organization trying to build a tech community in Kern County, Bakersfield’s home, and the managing partner of Start With Bakersfield , a venture capital firm that invests in local startups. Yet despite all his pro-Bakersfield arguments (cheaper housing! chances to network with local power brokers!), Mershon keeps watching people leave for techier cities. It’s a chicken-and-egg problem of the highest order. Technical people won’t stay in Bakersfield because not enough companies will hire them or invest in their startups, and companies and investors won’t come to Bakersfield because they find the local tech talent unimpressive. Other cities have so much momentum that Mershon has concluded that Bakersfield and similar places are bound to fall further behind. “It’s just insurmountable,” he says. \nMershon’s pessimism is borne out by evidence. The latest comes from the Brookings Institution, which studied a database of computer skills (from database entry to coding software) used in various occupations, then made a map of “digital scores” for U.S. metropolitan areas. Bakersfield tied with Las Vegas for the lowest average score among large cities, while San Jose scored the highest. What is most striking is that, though people like Mershon have been laboring for years to bridge the digital gap between cities like San Jose and those like Bakersfield, it doesn’t seem to be fully working. The Brookings researchers ranked cities’ scores from 2002, then looked at how much each of those cities had improved as of 2016. They found that, in general, the cities whose scores used to be lowest have been closing the gap with the ones that used to be stronger, as technology infiltrates all kinds of occupations, from nursing to construction work. But when it comes to the highly digital employment that tends to be well-paid, like computer programming, San Jose and San Francisco are even further ahead now than they used to be. Nicolas Rapp \nStartups depend on venture capital funding, and that kind of investment is getting more concentrated in Silicon Valley—so that’s where startups tend to put their roots and start hiring. Also, because both startups and more established tech companies hire a relatively small number of super-talented, creative employees—the kind who can come up with moneymaking innovations—they tend to hire in the places, like San Francisco and San Jose, where those would-be employees are known to gravitate. Both these effects are compounded by the fact that tech has become a winner-take-all market, with companies like Google (googl) and Apple (aapl) consolidating their power—giving an advantage to the cities where they’re based. People benefit from “living and working in the right place,” says Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings. “That’s always been true, but digital technologies have really amplified that effect.” \nIt’s an unsettling conclusion. People understand that a lot of well-paid blue-collar laborers and office workers have found their jobs automated into extinction, but we have consoled ourselves with the thought that all this change will create new jobs for the people who have been displaced. The Brookings finding confirms that while some technical jobs are going to some of the cities that have been most hollowed out, the best ones aren’t. Mershon, in Bakersfield, has started to feel that he should be encouraging the city’s brightest residents to leave town after all, to give them a shot at doing well. He consoles himself with the thought that Start With Bakersfield could at least invest in some of them before sending them off to become successful entrepreneurs elsewhere. \nA version of this article appears in the Jan. 1, 2018 issue of Fortune with the headline, “A Revolution of Have and Have-Nots.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-07T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-07T14:00:54.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

A spokesman for Pai at the FCC, for its part, only said Thursday: \"We do not comment on security measures or concerns.\"\nBut sources at the agency said that federal law enforcement had intervened in the matter, and other FCC offices are expected to be briefed on the matter. The FBI did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.\nA spokeswoman for the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on the annual Las Vegas-based trade show, also declined to comment. Earlier, though, CTA's leader, Gary Shapiro, told the publication Digital Trends that he did not know why Pai had canceled — but raised the fact that he had recently been \"subject to vicious and direct attacks and threats.\"\nFor months, Pai has been hounded by his critics, particularly online, who view his vote to repeal net neutrality rules as tantamount to destroying the internet. Pai has lamented in speeches and tweets that he and his family have been mocked, attacked and threatened, in public as well as on Twitter, where Pai himself is active.\nBy the nature of the job, the chairmanship of the FCC is an especially public role, and threats to its leaders and commissioners aren't exactly new. In 2014, for example, protesters descended on the home of then-Chairman Tom Wheeler, a Democrat, and prevented him from leaving his driveway. Then, too, net neutrality had been the issue at hand.\nIn the most recent debate, though, tensions have been especially high, driven in no small part by broader frustrations among the public with the Trump administration writ large. If the death threats continue, it is unclear how Pai and his fellow commissioners will proceed.\nFor now, Democratic Commissioner Mignon Clyburn and Republican Commissioners Michael O'Rielly and Brendan Carr each plan to attend CES. So will Maureen Ohlhausen, the acting leader of their sister agency, the Federal Trade Commission. Ohlhausen had been slated to appear alongside Pai at the annual Vegas event.\n— By Tony Romm , Re/code .\nCNBC's parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Recode's parent Vox, and the companies have a content-sharing arrangement.\nWATCH: Pai says Twitter part of problem with net neutrality show chapters FCC head Ajit Pai says with net neutrality, 'Twitter is a part of the problem' 12:56 PM ET Wed, 29 Nov 2017 | 01:11", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-04T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T00:05:50.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Chilean equities were lifted by data that showed the economy grew at its fastest pace in almost two years, while Brazil's main stock index hit a record high after data showed industrial production rose for the third month in row. Demand for Brazilian stocks has been fed so far this year by the view that leftist ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva could be convicted at the end of January in a corruption trial, which may dim chances for the left to win in elections this year. A Reuters poll on Friday found the Brazilian currency would likely lose ground this year amid uncertainty over whether President Michel Temer's structural reforms will survive the most wide-open election in decades. Meanwhile, the Mexican peso was seen losing ground in the first half of the year as traders hedge against a potential victory by a leftist frontrunner. Mexico's peso led gains for the region's currencies on Friday, capping a week where it advanced about 2.5 percent against the dollar. The peso has been helped by bets that the country's central bank could hike interest rates again, with inflation close to a 16-year high. However, analysts warned the currency would struggle to gain much more ground amid fears that U.S. President Donald Trump could pull out of a free-trade deal with Mexico. The next set of talks between Mexico, the United States and Canada on the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are set for later this month in Montreal. \nKey Latin American stock indexes and currencies at 2025 GMT: \nStock indexes daily % YTD % Latest change change MSCI Emerging Markets 1201.53 0.75 2.94 MSCI LatAm 2972.61 0.46 4.63 Brazil Bovespa 79071.47 0.54 3.49 Mexico IPC 49770.78 0.05 0.84 Chile IPSA 5695.43 1.07 2.35 Chile IGPA 28636.41 1.09 2.34 Argentina MerVal 32205.59 0.79 7.12 Colombia IGBC 11781.61 0.49 3.61 Venezuela IBC 1263.67 0 0.04 Currencies daily % YTD % change change \nLatest \nBrazil real 3.2291 0.10 2.61 Mexico peso 19.1850 0.45 2.68 Chile peso 605.8 -0.15 1.46 Colombia peso 2905.3 -0.66 2.64 Peru sol 3.212 -0.09 0.78 Argentina peso (interbank) 18.8600 -1.22 -1.38 Argentina peso (parallel) 19.4 0.05 -0.88 \n(Writing by Michael O'Boyle; Editing by David Gregorio)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T23:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-06T15:04:30.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Reuters reported in December that Didi plans to enter Mexico this year. \nCheng Wei, founder and CEO of Didi, said in Wednesday's statement that \"globalization is a top strategic priority for Didi.\" \nDidi first invested $100 million in 99 in January 2017, getting a stake and management rights in the Brazilian app. \nOne source with knowledge of the matter said the funds selling their stakes in 99 started looking for a buyer several months ago, in mid-2017. \nRiverwood, Monashees, Tiger Global, and Soft Bank Group did not reply to requests for comment. \nDidi has made no secret of its desire to expand beyond China, particularly in light of the growing number of Chinese customers who travel overseas. \nIn December, Didi raised $4 billion from investors, in part to fund global expansion, following on from a $5.5 billion fundraising in April.

U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan must approve the accord. \nThe settlement, smaller than many analysts anticipated, is an important milestone for the company as it seeks to dig out from under a massive graft scandal, in which contractors bilked the oil giant out of billions by bribing company executives. \nBut the deal reduces chances the world's most indebted oil company will pay a dividend for 2017, much anticipated by investors who have not seen such a payment since 2014 when the scandal came to light, a source familiar with the matter said. \n\"This has been one of the most important overhangs for Petrobras especially for the extremely high uncertainty around the values of this potential liability,\" JPMorgan said in a client note, adding that it had expected a figure above $5 billion. \"The settlement puts an end to that uncertainty.\" \nPreferred shares ticked up 0.48 percent to 16.63 reais. U.S.-traded shares were unchanged at $10.70. \nMoody's brushed off concerns about the impact of the fine on the company's balance sheet, noting it was expected to generate some $30 billion in cash this year and make capital investments of around $15 billion. \n\"Petrobras' liquidity position is adequate and the payment of the agreed class action settlement amount is not a material concern,\" it said. \nThe plaintiffs were upbeat too. \n\"This litigation and its ultimate resolution has yielded an excellent result for the class,\" said Jeremy Lieberman, an attorney for the investors. He called the deal \"historic\" and said it was the largest ever involving a foreign securities issuer. \nInvestors had sued Petrobras after prosecutors in Brazil accused executives of accepting more than $2 billion in bribes over a decade, mainly from construction and engineering companies. \nPetrobras claimed it was itself a victim and denied wrongdoing in a securities filing on Wednesday. But its market value has plunged as its central role in the scheme continues to be unwound by investigators. \nFor the past four years, Brazil has been rocked by the so-called \"Car Wash\" investigation, which has exposed kickbacks to executives of state-run companies and politicians who appointed them to their jobs. \nPetrobras said it hoped the settlement would resolve all investor claims in the United States. Analysts at Brazilian bank BTG Pactual said the market had expected a settlement of $5 billion to $10 billion. \nThe deal does not include investors who bought non U.S.-based Petrobras securities outside the United States, according to the company. \nThe deal came days after Brazil's securities regulator CVM formally accused eight former Petrobras executives of corruption. \nThe accusations relate to possible irregularities in the contracting process for three drilling ships, according to a legal filing by the regulator last Friday. \nAmong the accused in CVM's filing are former Petrobras Chief Executives Maria das Gracas Foster and Jose Sergio Gabrielli. Neither could be reached for comment. \nThe largest securities fraud settlements in U.S. history include $7.2 billion stemming from the collapse of Enron, $6.2 billion over an accounting scandal at WorldCom and $3.2 billion over an accounting scandal at Tyco International, according to Stanford Law School's Securities Class Action Clearinghouse.

Although the party needs only two more seats for control of the Senate, 23 of the 33 senators up for re-election are Democrats, making them vulnerable. Two are independents who caucus with the Democrats, and only eight are Republicans.\nAdditionally, Republican leadership in Congress may welcome the split, as it could give them an opportunity to steer Trump in a direction that is more favorable to their mainstream conservative agenda.\nThe spat between Trump and Bannon slashes an alliance that helped galvanize the president's Republican base during his election. Bannon was a staunch Trump backer from the early days of the campaign, and is credited with pushing ethno-nationalism and populism onto the forefront of national politics.\nSome observers, however, are questioning the veracity of Bannon's accusations in \"Fire and Fury,\" with many calling him an opportunist and a self-promoter, skeptical of how much stock to put in his words. Bannon may also try to make amends — on Wednesday night he praised Trump on his Breitbart radio show, calling him \"a great man.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-05T16:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-05T16:50:59.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

With $34.7 billion in assets, the funds make up a small but growing part of the $3.5 trillion ETF industry, according to ETF.com.\nBut the effort by Direxion to bring them into the shadowy world of digital currency is raising some concern on Wall Street. The firm filed its application with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Jan. 4, starting a process that those familiar with it say could take six to nine months.\n\"That would be insane for them to actually approve this. Then they're putting a rubber stamp on it as an asset, and I don't think governments want to go there yet,\" said Michael Cohn, chief investment strategist at Atlantis Asset Management. \"It just seems as though it's not something I'd want to put my clients into in any way, shape or form. You can only be embarrassed.\"\nshow chapters 2018 ETF market predictions 10:54 AM ET Wed, 3 Jan 2018 | 03:38 While it's far too early to tell what kind of chance Direxion has for gaining approval, it's important to understand what the proposed funds are and what they are not.\nTheir names are Direxion Daily Bitcoin Bear 1X Shares, Direxion Daily Bitcoin 1.25X Bull Shares, Direxion Daily Bitcoin 1.5 Bull Shares, Direxion Daily Bitcoin 2X Bull Shares and Direxion Daily Bitcoin 2X Bear Shares. Direxion did not respond to a request for comment.\nIf approved, the latter four shares would use leverage to replicate the daily price movements of bitcoin by 1.25, 1.5 and two times respectively. The bear fund would effectively \"short\" bitcoin, or capitalize on declines in price.\nHowever, the funds wouldn't be tied to the price of bitcoin per se but rather the futures price traded on the Cboe and CME. As such, the Direxion application points out that the funds \"should not be expected to track the performance of the target benchmark for any period longer than one business day.\"\n\"There are a lot of conflicting attitudes about this thing. I don't think the SEC can wrap their arms around this,\" Cohn said. \"It's not an asset class, it's not a currency. It's going to be evolved into a technology. As to whether that technology is viable, that remains to be seen.\"\nIndeed, Merrill Lynch recently raised eyebrows when it slapped a ban on bitcoin trading , while other Wall Street principals such as J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink have decried it as well.\n\"Can you imagine what a 2X bitcoin put or call is going to do? It's going to be amazing volatility,\" said Nick Colas, a bitcoin watcher and co-founder of DataTrek Research. \"It's eye-watering.\"\nColas said he sees the attempts at leveraging bitcoin as part of traders' quest for volatility, which has been noticeably missing from most of the market but is pretty much a daily fact of life for cryptocurrencies.\n\"This is the analog of the search for volatility,\" he said. \"Obviously, bitcoin does have a lot of volatility on its own. This is an attempt to create a product that has some volatility that leverages that.\"\nHowever, the Direxion efforts could represent just another step in the maturation process for cryptocurrencies, whose popularity has exploded over the past year. The top five offerings alone — bitcoin, ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and cardano — have a combined market cap of over half a trillion dollars, according to CoinMarketCap. Some 40 cryptos are worth more than $1 billion each.\nWatchers of the growing space figured it was only a matter of time before bitcoin ETF applications accelerated after the CME and Cboe greenlighted futures trading.\n\"We're seeing different measures and steps and approaches to attempt to further legitimize digital currency. This is part of the reason why I say digital currency is here to stay,\" said Sheila Warren, the World Economic Forum's head of blockchain, which is the technology that powers cryptocurrencies.\n\"Institutional investors and others are going to respond to [the Direxion funds]. That's what's intended,\" she added. \"Is that a good thing or a bad thing? That's a matter of opinion.\"\nWarren said the SEC will apply consumer protection principles when evaluating applications from Direxion and others. The commission thus far has taken a fairly dim view of bitcoin-related ETFs, but that was before futures trading began.\nWith price discovery more attainable, that could push the SEC to take another look. The commission does not comment on ongoing applications.\n\"There's going to be a lot of ETFs getting approved this year,\" said David Drake, founder and chairman of LDJ Capital. \"I don't think it's going to be oversaturated. The market can handle quite a few of them.\"\nDrake said he expects the SEC to be \"very careful\" when reviewing the Direxion application as well as what he expects to be a fairly large flow of other applicants this year.\nWATCH: Direxion isn't the only firm looking to launch bitcoin-related ETFs show chapters Bitcoin expert Brian Kelly launches a suite of crypto ETFs 8:20 PM ET Thu, 4 Jan 2018 | 01:17", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T21:30:35.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The stock market has become very, very overbought; the S&P 500 's relative strength index has now moved above 85, and sentiment has become very, very bullish. So bullish, in fact, that it has now reached levels that are usually followed by short-term pullbacks. \n\nNot only have we heard many bullish comments from pundits and billionaires alike, but the latest Daily Sentiment Index data show futures traders have become wildly bullish on the stock market.\n\nSomething else to chew on here is what truly drove last week's impressive price action. The credit seems to be going to the expected impact of tax cuts and the synchronized global expansion we are seeing. That's great, and probably true. But did things really improve that much last week?\n\nYes, we got some better-than-expected data last week (at least until the employment report on Friday) both domestically and overseas. Still, they were not shockingly high numbers, and we did not see significant moves in any other market.\n\nInstead, consider this theory: the data were simply good enough to help the stock market rally a bit; but then the algorithms kicked in and took the market higher, which caused so-called performance fear to kick in for institutional investors who don't want to fall behind at the very start of the year. That, in turn, took the market higher and in turn pushed algorithms to buy more, and these two issues kept feeding on one another.\n\nOf course, this does not mean the market cannot go much higher over time; it could even go higher within a couple of weeks. We simply already knew the economy was growing on a synchronized basis, and the tax bill was passed before the holidays. Thus, we question whether last week's rally is something that will see a lot of upside follow-through in the near term.\n\nUltimately, our call in the very short term is the expectation of a stock market pullback this week. Once these broad indexes work off their overbought conditions, we'll want to see more solid earnings and how exactly companies will implement tax breaks.

And if adjusted for inflation, Gates' $100 billion fortune in 1999 would be worth about $147 billion today.\nStill, of those individuals whose wealth is publicly traceable, Bezos is the richest person alive. As of Tuesday, Bezos' net worth is $104.5 billion, according to Forbes.\nAnd the self-made fortune is impressive. Bezos hasn't always been the billionaire titan he is today. He was born the son of a 16-year-old mom and deadbeat dad. And he didn't set out to be the CEO of an e-commerce juggernaut. \nPhoto by Bloomberg Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos \"I won the lottery with my mom. Thanks for literally everything, Mom\" Jeff Bezos was born on January 12, 1964, as Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen. His biological dad, Ted Jorgensen, met and started dating his mother, Jacklyn Gise, when they were both in high school. Jorgensen was 18 and Gise was 16 when she became pregnant. They flew to Mexico with their parents' money to get married.\nJorgensen belonged to a unicycle troupe and worked at a retail store making $1.25 an hour, so he didn't have much money. He was also \"had a habit of drinking too much,\" according to \"The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon,\" by journalist and biographer Brad Stone . When Jeff Bezos was 17 months old, his mom divorced Jorgensen. \nIn 1968, Gise remarried Miguel Bezos, who arrived in Miami in 1962 from Cuba knowing only one word of English: \"hamburger.\" Jorgensen agreed to let Bezos adopt his son and, at 4 years old, Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen became Jeffrey Preston Bezos.\nBiographer Stone suggests that Bezos' childhood may have contributed to his obsession with success. \"It is of course unknowable whether the unusual circumstances of his birth helped to create that fecund entrepreneurial mix of intelligence, ambition, and a relentless need to prove himself. Two other technology icons, Steve Jobs and Larry Ellison, were adopted, and the experience is thought by some to have given each a powerful motivation to succeed,\" Stone writes.\nI won the lottery with my mom. Thanks for literally everything, Mom. pic.twitter.com/gEuVgxotdw \n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) May 14, 2017 Growing up, Bezos spent summers with his grandparents on their Texas ranch, he says in the commencement speech he gave at Princeton in 2010. \"I helped fix windmills, vaccinate cattle, and do other chores. We also watched soap operas every afternoon, especially 'Days of our Lives,'\" says Bezos.\nBezos would also occasionally get to road trip with his grandparents.\n\"My grandparents belonged to a Caravan Club, a group of Airstream trailer owners who travel together around the U.S. and Canada. And every few summers, we'd join the caravan,\" Bezos says in graduation speech . \"We'd hitch up the Airstream trailer to my grandfather's car, and off we'd go, in a line with 300 other Airstream adventurers. I loved and worshipped my grandparents and I really looked forward to these trips.\"\nLaunching Amazon: \"I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice\" Bezos got straight As in high school, was the valedictorian of his class and was accepted early admission to Princeton, according to Stone's biography. For a time in college, he thought he would be a theoretical physicist .\nBut it was years later, while working in finance in New York City that he had the idea to start Amazon.\n\"I came across the fact that Web usage was growing at 2,300 percent per year. I'd never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast, and the idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles — something that simply couldn't exist in the physical world — was very exciting to me,\" says Bezos, in his 2010 Princeton address.\nAt the time, Bezos was just 30 and had been married for a year. \"I told my wife MacKenzie that I wanted to quit my job and go do this crazy thing that probably wouldn't work since most startups don't, and I wasn't sure what would happen after that,\" he says. \n\"After much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice.\" -Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, Blue Origin His wife told him to go for it.\n\"As a young boy, I'd been a garage inventor . I'd invented an automatic gate closer out of cement-filled tires, a solar cooker that didn't work very well out of an umbrella and tinfoil, baking-pan alarms to entrap my siblings,\" he says. \"I'd always wanted to be an inventor, and she wanted me to follow my passion.\"\nBut not everyone was on board. Bezos boss took a walk through Central Park and told Bezos that, while it sounded like a \"really good idea,\" it would be an even better idea for somebody who didn't already have a good career.\n\"That logic made some sense to me, and he convinced me to think about it for 48 hours before making a final decision,\" says Bezos . \"Seen in that light, it really was a difficult choice, but ultimately, I decided I had to give it a shot. I didn't think I'd regret trying and failing. And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all.\n\"After much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice.\"\nThe early days of Amazon: \"I thought maybe one day we would be able to afford a forklift\" When Amazon first started, it sold only books. Bezos would drive the packages to the post office himself in his 1987 Chevy Blazer . \"I thought maybe one day we would be able to afford a forklift,\" Bezos tells Charlie Rose in a wide-ranging interview in 2016. \"And it is very, it's very, very different today.\"\nAfter books, the next items Bezos added to Amazon were music and videos. Then, he asked customers to see what else they would want to buy from the online retailer.\n\"I sent an email message out to the customer base, actually a thousand randomly selected customers, and I said, besides books, music and video, what would you like to see us sell? And the list came back incredibly long,\" explains Bezos. \n\"It was basically just whatever the person had on their mind right now,\" says Bezos, and that sparked an idea.\nshow chapters Here's what makes up the Jeff Bezos empire      12:48 PM ET Thu, 29 June 2017 | 01:05 \"One of customers said, 'I wish you sold windshield wipers because I need windshield wipers for my car.' A light kind of went on in my head. You know, people — people will want to use this new fangled e-commerce way of shopping for everything,\" Bezos says to Rose .\n\"People are very convenience-motivated,\" says Bezos. \"So that really started the kind of the expansion into all categories, consumer electronics, and then apparel, and so on.\"\nExpand he did. Today, Amazon sells almost everything. From toilet paper to groceries to electronics to fashion to furniture.\nWhen Bezos enters a new product category, he is not intimidated by a lack of expertise.\n\"I am never disappointed when we're not good at something be", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T20:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T20:34:03.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

But this was something the central bank would not be able to address. Other central banks faced the same problem.\n“The Bank of Israel’s position is that they should be viewed as a financial asset,” Baudot-Trajtenberg told a meeting of Israel’s parliamentary finance committee, noting that there was no government responsibility for investors in bitcoin.\nThe central bank, Baudot-Trajtenberg said, was studying the issue of virtual currency but not much could be learned from what exists globally since no regulator anywhere in the world had issued guidelines to the banking system on how to act in relation to customers’ activity in virtual currencies.\n“There is a real difficulty in issuing sweeping guidelines to the system regarding the proper way to estimate, manage, and monitor the risks inherent in such activity,” she said. “Beyond the risks to the customer there are also compliance risks to the bank.”\nThe value of a bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, surged in mid-December to nearly $20,000, then dropped to less than $12,000 at the end of the month. It was trading on Monday around $15,370.\nANONYMOUS NATURE Bitcoin is a publicly available ledger of a finite number of digital “coins”, which backers say can be used as a currency without the support of any country’s central bank. It is “mined” by computers, which are awarded new coins for working out complex mathematical formulas.\nSeveral other cryptocurrencies have been launched that work on similar principles.\nCommittee members during the meeting on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies urged Israel’s regulators to quickly come up with regulations.\n“There seems to be a greater possibility that they will become central to our financial lives,” said Moshe Gafni, the chairman of the panel.\nHe called on regulators to submit to the committee within a month how they tend to deal with bitcoin and the like.\nStill, Israel’s regulators are generally opposed to giving credence to virtual currencies since they are based on private initiatives and they do not have the same level of investor confidence as regular currencies.\n“The anonymous nature of virtual currencies leads to the possibility that they may be used to launder money, finance crime, and so forth,” Baudot-Trajenberg said.\nShlomit Wagman, head of Israel’s anti-money-laundering authority said a thorough investigation was needed since terrorist organisations use virtual currency platforms.\nLast week, Israel’s markets regulator proposed regulations that would ban from trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange companies whose main business revolves around bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nReporting by Steven Scheer; editing by Ralph Boulton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T15:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T15:45:16.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Morgan Chase Institute found that health-care spending spikes by 60 percent in the week after individuals receive their tax refunds. And those higher payouts last for about 75 days following the receipt of the refund, the think tank found.\nFamilies who have less cash available were more likely to increase their health-care spending after their refund. Account holders with less than $536 in their checking accounts increased health spending by a whopping 220 percent post-refund. Those with more than $3,500 in their checking accounts increased their health outlay by 11 percent.\nThe payments were measured through immediate payment methods including debit cards or electronic payments. Credit card use for health expenses did not change, the research found.\n\"People are in effect waiting for this tax refund to come, then seeking care,\" said Diana Farrell, president and CEO of the J.P. Morgan Chase Institute.\nThe refunds prompted individuals to either visit dentists' or doctors' offices, or to pay outstanding hospital bills, according to the research.\n\"We know the dynamics of health-care problems is they don't age well,\" Farrell said. \"If you're waiting to seek care, you're not getting care when you need it.\"\nThe research is evidence of the financial volatility Americans live with day to day, according to Farrell, with their income and spending going up and down all the time.\nThe data did not include individuals who hold health savings accounts or flexible spending accounts, which are tax advantaged ways to save for these costs in advance.\nIndividuals can take steps to prepare for these expenses in advance, according to Steve Auerbach, CEO of Alegeus, a consumer directed health-care technology company.\nFirst, Auerbach recommends taking advantage of health savings accounts if they are offered by your employer. You must have a qualified high-deductible health plan in order to have a health savings account.\nThe advantages of HSAs is that they are triple-tax free: The money is invested pretax, and there are no taxes on the interest or when the money is taken out for eligible medical expenses. Because you are not required to take the money out and you can take it with you if you leave your employer, it is also considered a potential retirement savings vehicle.\nshow chapters Plan for health care in retirement 8:01 AM ET Mon, 27 Nov 2017 | 01:07 Usually when picking benefits, individuals default to plans that have lower deductibles. But high deductible plans are often offset by a lower premium, Auerbach said. Those savings can then be placed in an HSA.\nIf you do not have access to an HSA, you may want to consider a flexible spending account to cover out-of-pocket expenses, Auerbach said. Like HSAs, flexible spending accounts are funded with pretax money. But there are limits to how long you have to use the funds.\nConsumers who want to better plan for health costs may also want to check online tools to help estimate how much they should save, Auerbach said.\n\"Saving for your health care is just like saving for your retirement,\" Auerbach said. \"It's just another expense you have to plan for.\"\nJ.P.

Intel, Nvidia and Amazon were among companies with self-driving car announcements this week at CES. Getty Images Intel Corp. Senior Vice President and CEO and Chief Technology Officer of Mobileye Amnon Shashua (L) speaks in front of a Ford Fusion with Mobileye autonomous driving technology during a keynote address by Intel Corp. \nThe promise of self-driving cars has gone mainstream, and this week's massive CES trade show was proof. \nAmazon , Intel , Nvidia and Cisco all made announcements about autonomous driving at CES, joining a host of rivals and partners that have publicly reported their efforts. To accommodate, the annual Las Vegas trade show expanded its space for self-driving technologies this year by over one third. \nThey're coming late to the game: Alphabet's Waymo, Elon Musk's Tesla and the auto giants have all been developing self-driving technology for years. But nearly all the major tech companies now agree that the market potential is too big to ignore. \nHere's where the 12 most valuable U.S. tech companies are focusing their investment in autonomous driving, ranked by market cap from biggest to smallest. Apple Source: Apple Inc. Apple CarPlay. \nRumors of an Apple Car were put to bed last year when CEO Tim Cook said the company was working on \"autonomous systems,\" or software that could power self-driving cars. That was a relief to investors who worried about Apple taking on Tesla , Toyota , GM and other car manufacturers. \nCook hasn't made firm promises about self-driving technologies or dates by which they'll hit the market. Apple is partnering with Hertz to test its autonomous software in some of the company's rental cars (Lexus SUVs) on the streets of San Francisco, according to filings with the California Department of Motor Vehicles. \nSiri, CarPlay and other Apple software will probably get more usage once autonomous vehicles become a reality and drivers are free to pay attention to their screens, not the road. Alphabet \nGoogle has been talking up autonomous vehicles since 2009 when Sebastian Thrun launched the company's groundbreaking driverless car effort. \nIn late 2016, Alphabet renamed its self-driving car unit Waymo. Seen as a leader in the nascent industry, Waymo is building an end-to-end self-driving system filled with sensors and software so \"you can go door to door without taking the wheel,\" as its website says. Waymo claims to have 4 million miles of real-world driving experience and data gathered from cities including Mountain View, California, as well as Austin and Phoenix. \nWaymo has an early-rider program in Phoenix that lets people use its autonomous cars for their daily transportation needs. It's teaming up with Avis to make the vehicles rentable. The company has also partnered with AutoNation to provide vehicle maintenance and support, and with Intel for processors to power the cars. Microsoft VCG | Getty Images Baidu driverless cars in test run during the 3rd World Internet Conference (WIC) on November 17, 2016 in Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province of China. \nMicrosoft has a number of partnerships with automakers developing internet-connected and autonomous vehicles including BMW, Ford, Renault-Nissan, Toyota and Volvo. But its most intriguing deal in this new market is with the Chinese internet company Baidu . \nBaidu is developing an open source platform that it hopes will become the \"Android\" of self-driving cars, dubbed Apollo. Microsoft joined Baidu's Apollo \"alliance,\" gaining a channel for sales of Azure cloud services to companies that use Apollo to build and run their self-driving cars. That deal only applies to companies using Apollo outside of China. \nAdditionally, Microsoft has partnered with and provides Azure cloud services to Ola, Uber's competitor in India, which is expected to offer self-driving vehicles on its app eventually. Amazon Getty Images \nAmazon's efforts in autonomous transportation appear most focused on getting items to consumers as quickly and efficiently as possible. \nAt CES, Amazon was part of a Toyota announcement evealing a self-driving food delivery vehicle called the e-Pallette, just a concept car for now. According to NBC News , Tim Collins, a vice president for Amazon Logistics, said that the partnership with Toyota allows Amazon to \"collaborate and explore new opportunities to improve the speed and quality of delivery for our customers.\" \nThe Wall Street Journal reported in April that Amazon has cobbled together a team of about a dozen people to work on driverless vehicles for delivery. And in January, Recode reported on a patent that was awarded to Amazon for autonomous cars navigating reversible lanes. Facebook Sheryl Sandberg speaks about overcoming grief and resilience at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco. \nChief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg traveled to Germany in September to address the prestigious Frankfurt Motor Show, attended by Chancellor Angela Merkel . \n\"We're the only company in Silicon Valley that's not building a car,\" she quipped. \nAmong the big five tech companies, Facebook has perhaps the smallest role in the car itself, but Sandberg was in Frankfurt to talk about its sponsorship of a \"new mobility world,\" tying together the auto and tech industry. \nFacebook's research in virtual and augmented reality will potentially be used to give consumers a feel for the autonomous driving experience. It's all pretty vague right now. Intel Source: Mobileye A still image from a Mobileye video. \nThe chipmaker wants to become one of the world's biggest automotive suppliers. To that end, it acquired Mobileye for around $15.3 billion last year and partnered with Waymo to provide sensors and connectivity. \nMobileye, out of Israel, makes systems used for collision detection and other features in self-driving vehicles. Intel made a number of self-driving vehicle announcements at CES. It revealed that BMW, Nissan and Volkswagen all plan to use Mobileye technology to create \"high-definition maps\" that enable self-driving cars to get around safely. \nThe company is building a test fleet of 100 cars and showed off one of them at the show. The cars are equipped with twelve cameras, radar and laser scanners, and other chips, processors and systems developed by Intel and Mobileye. Oracle David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images Larry Ellison, chairman of Oracle Corp., speaks during the Oracle OpenWorld 2016 conference in San Francisco, on Sunday, Sept. 18, 2016. \nFinding a role for Oracle in the self-driving revolution will be quite a stretch. The closest thing we've heard so far is co-founder and Chairman Larry Ellison refer to a \"self-driving database.\" \nIn a September earnings call with analysts, Ellison compared the database of the future with the car of the future. \n\"Self-driving cars eliminate the labor cost of driving, plus the high cost associated with human driving errors,\" he said. \"Self-driving database eliminates the labor cost of tuning, managing, and upgrading the database, thus avoiding all of the costly downtime associated with human error.\" \nIn other words, don't expect Oracle to drive you to and from work.

Many customers were seen asking for refunds on memberships, which cost $45 annually, and others were concerned about where they would pick up prescriptions.\nshow chapters Walmart to shutter some of its Sam's Club locations 23 Hours Ago | 00:58 Late in the day Thursday, Sam's Club CEO John Furner wrote in a companywide email:\n\"Transforming our business means managing our real estate portfolio — we need a strong fleet of clubs that are fit for the future. After a thorough review, it became clear we had built clubs in some locations that impacted other clubs, and where population had not grown as anticipated. We've decided to right-size our fleet and better align our locations with our strategy. ... We will work to place as many associates as possible in new roles at nearby locations, and we'll provide them with support, resources, and severance pay to those eligible.\"\nWalmart said it would book a charge of 14 cents per share related to the closures, which would show up mainly in its fourth-quarter results. The company said it would share more details when it reports earnings on Feb. 20.\nWalmart \"is taking prudent steps to prepare for the next generation of retail warfare, one in which speed will be king and delivery will be judged by hours and not days,\" Cowen and Co. analyst Oliver Chen wrote in a note to clients Friday morning.\n\"We believe Sam's Club leadership will continue to execute against other initiatives ... as management noted that while results have improved over the last several quarters, the retailer can do better as Sam's Club has under-performed club peers,\" Chen said. Those competitors include Costco , BJ's Wholesale Club and Boxed.\nMoving forward, many analysts anticipate Sam's Club will focus on growing its e-commerce business, amassing a higher-quality grocery selection, marketing its private labels and finding new members.\nFurner has said the brand is looking to tap into households with annual income between $75,000 to $125,000.\nHere is a list of the stores being closed:\n8801 Old Seward Hwy, Anchorage, AK 1074 N Muldoon Rd, Anchorage, AK 48 College Rd, Fairbanks, AK 3900 Grants Mill Rd, Irondale, AL 2425 E Florence Blvd, Casa Grande, AZ 5757 E State Route 69, Prescott Valley, AZ 1375 S Arizona Ave, Chandler, AZ 15255 N Northsight Blvd, Scottsdale, AZ 3360 El Camino Ave, Sacramento, CA 17835 Gale Ave, City of Industry, CA 12540 Beach Blvd, Stanton, CA 12920 Foothill Blvd, Sylmar, CA 69 Pavilions Dr, Manchester, CT 2 Boston Post Rd, Orange, CT 355 FL-436, Fern Park, FL 7233 N Seacrest Blvd, Lantana, FL 5135 S Dale Mabry Hwy, Tampa, FL 2994 Turner Hill Rd, Lithonia, GA 501 N Randall Rd, Batavia, IL 21430 S Cicero Ave, Matteson, IL 6600 44th Ave, Moline, IL 808 S Illinois Rte 59, Naperville, IL 900 S Barrington Rd, Streamwood, IL 1055 McHenry Rd, Wheeling, IL 460 S Weber Rd, Romeoville, IL 3015 W 86th St, Indianapolis, IN 10859 E Washington St, Indianapolis, IN 4024 Elkhart Rd #1, Goshen, IN 9598 Cortana Pl, Baton Rouge, LA 9750 Reisterstown Rd, Owings Mills, MD 1 Tobias Boland Way, Worcester, MA 340 E.

Just 2.7 percent of borrowers, or about 1.36 million, still owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. \"HELOC's are very popular, but they recently lost a major benefit.\" \nGenerally, there are two ways to take cash out of an equity-rich home. \nOne is to refinance the original mortgage to a larger loan. This could possibly change the interest rate on the loan. The other way is to take out a second loan, either a home equity mortgage, which is a lump sum, or a home equity line of credit (HELOC), which is essentially like a checking account on your home. \nHELOCs are very popular, but they recently lost a major benefit. Under the new Republican tax law, the interest paid on these loans is no longer deductible . Borrowers used to be able to deduct interest paid on up to $100,000 in home equity loan debt. \nFor primary loans, mortgage borrowers can still deduct the interest paid on up to $750,000 worth of mortgage debt, down from $1 million under the previous tax code. That raises the question of whether it is better just to do a cash-out refinance instead. \n\"Homeowners who will still itemize under the new tax plan will likely find the lack of deductibility of HELOC interest swings the value pendulum towards cash-out refinances as a way to tap their equity,\" said Ben Graboske, executive vice president of Black Knight. \n\"This is particularly true for those with low first-lien balances drawing greater amounts of equity. On the other hand, for those with high first-lien balances drawing low volumes of equity, the math still tends to favor HELOCs.\" show chapters 2:18 PM ET Wed, 20 Dec 2017 | 02:43 \nWith mortgage rates currently lower than they were a year ago, cash-out refinances have been growing in popularity. \nBorrowers doing cash-out refinances withdrew $68,000 in equity on average for a total of $26 billion in the third quarter of last year. Cash-outs now account for 62 percent of all refinances, but it is still far far less than during the housing boom in 2005, when borrowers were essentially using their homes as cash machines. \n\"The Great Recession wasn't all that long ago, and the memory is likely still in the backs of minds of both lenders and borrowers alike,\" Graboske said. \nLenders are considerably more risk averse today, so mortgage underwriting is much more strict. Borrowers are exhibiting more restraint as well, in terms of both deciding whether or not to tap into that available equity, and if so, how much, according to Graboske. \nThere is also the possibility that home values in some regions most affected by the new tax law could fall, causing homeowners to lose some of this new-found equity. \nHomeowners can now only deduct $10,000 in property taxes. In high tax states, that could put downward pressure on home values. Homeowners with loans of more than $750,000, who are currently grandfathered into the $1 million mortgage deduction cap, should consult their tax advisors as to whether a cash-out refinance would change their status.The law is currently unclear on that point.

The highly anticipated rocket, which is SpaceX's largest, will take its maiden flight soon after that, she said.\nSpaceX also plans to launch another Falcon 9 (F9) for communications provider SES and the Luxembourg government from another launchpad (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral in three weeks.\nThe satellite was reportedly lost, possibly falling back into the atmosphere, according to The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources.\nVery little was known about the mission at all, such as the cost of the satellite and its exact purpose. This was SpaceX's third launch for the U.S. military, according to Ars Technica .\nSpaceX has driven down the costs of launching rockets, but has also had some high-profile failures, including an explosion on a launch pad in 2016 that claimed a communications satellite that cost an estimated $300 million to build.\nThe Falcon 9 rocket landed safely after the launch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T17:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T17:39:07.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Morgan to help it with a sale process, as the one-time Wall Street favorite battles falling demand for its sports cameras and drones. \nThe company’s shares, which fell as much as 33 percent to a record low of $5.04 on Monday, recouped some of their losses after the sale talks were first reported by CNBC. \n“We’ve always been clear that we are open to any opportunity that will help us scale our mission. JP Morgan is our banker, but there is no active engagement to sell,” GoPro said in emailed comments to Reuters. \n“It is our responsibility to scale the business, so if the right opportunity presented itself, it’s something we would consider,” it added. \nJ.P. Morgan declined to comment. \nEarlier in the day, the company lowered its fourth-quarter revenue forecast, following weak demand for its cameras in the holiday season, and announced a plan to exit the drone business. \nThe company has suffered a decline in demand for its eponymous cameras and Karma drones - mostly used by sports junkies and travel enthusiasts - for several quarters. \nFurthermore, it forecasts that tough regulatory hurdles in Europe and the United States will likely reduce the market for drones in the years ahead. Its exit from the drone business will take place after selling the existing Karma inventory, it added. \nThe company cut the price of its latest HERO6 cameras to $399 from $499 this week, a decision that it said would hurt revenue by around $80 million in the fourth quarter. \nMorgan Stanley said in a research note on Monday that the price cut would make earnings growth difficult in fiscal 2018. \nThe move followed weak demand for existing camera models. \n“Despite significant marketing support, we found consumers were reluctant to purchase HERO5 Black at the same price it launched at one year earlier,” Chief Executive Nick Woodman said in a statement alongside results. \nThe company now expects fourth-quarter revenue of $340 million, compared with its November projection of $470 million, plus or minus $10 million. It also said it plans to cut more than 250 jobs as it restructures. GoPro had 1,254 employees as of Sept. 30. \n“Cutting costs is a good move, although now it’s about if the company can turn this ship around themselves,” Daniel Ives, analyst at GBH Insights, said. \nWoodman will reduce his 2018 cash compensation to $1, the company said.

He just signed into law a tax reform bill that also landed a crippling blow to Obamacare through repeal of the individual mandate.\nHoping to remove President Trump from office by way of special counsel Robert Mueller 's eight-month-long Russian collusion investigation hasn't worked. At least it hasn't worked so far.\nSo enter phase four in the anti-Trump movement's efforts to remove, delegitimize, or at least weaken the duly elected president of the United States: They're making the case that he's crazy.\nThat effort got a major boost in recent days thanks to the release of Michael Wolff's new book \"Fire and Fury.\" The book includes several accounts of President Trump's alleged erratic behavior and general lack of fitness for the job.\nThe most damning thing about the book is that Wolff says many of those accusations about the president came from members of the White House staff and even the cabinet. That's unprecedented.\n\"Judging by the intense scrutiny that comes for a candidate and his or her entire family would any fully sane person ever run for President of the United States?\" Indeed, President Trump's public behavior is totally out of sync with what we've seen from every president before him. He's frequently tweeted angrily against members of his own cabinet and Republican Party. Even in live speeches, he's slung around racial slurs, like calling Senator Elizabeth Warren \"Pocahantas.\"\nAnd there was his disastrous comment that there were some \"fine people\" marching among white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia. Beyond his unusual comments and tweets, we also have the massive turnover inside his administration with a record number of positions shuffled through for a first year.\nBut let's take a reality check for a moment. Only a professional psychiatrist who has actually examined a patient can medically deem whether he or she is mentally fit for any job or office.\nYes, the 25 th Amendment to the Constitution allows for the vice president and the cabinet to jointly transfer the powers of the presidency to the vice president, (if the president objects, such a move would also require a two-thirds vote by Congress). But there seems to be no chance of that happening any time soon.\nNo matter how many \"Fire and Fury\" copies are sold and how many news media panels filled with amateur mental health pundits focus on the book's accusations, this is simply another futile path for those obsessed with not accepting the 2016 election results.\nBut as long as the issue of presidential sanity is front-and-center right now, it's not a bad idea to look at what really should serve as the criteria for judging the chief executive's fitness for office. That is, presidential policies.\nIf we look at some of what our past presidents have actually done, the question of presidential sanity should come up often. For example:\nWas it sane for President Obama to release tens of billions of dollars of Iranian money frozen by sanctions back to Iran in return for a promise to not develop nuclear weapons for a decade?\nWas it sane for President George W. Bush to pursue and execute a long war with Iraq instead of conducting a more focused and effective war on radical Islamic terror?\nWas it sane for President George H.W. Bush to support the Kurds in the first Iraq war and then abandon them?\nWas it sane for President Clinton to have a sexual affair with a 22-year old intern right in the White House?\nWas it sane for President Kennedy to support a ragtag bunch of revolutionaries to invade Cuba and then abandon them?\nWas it sane for Presidents Johnson and Nixon to prolong what they knew was an unwinnable war in Vietnam with massive bombing campaigns against North Vietnam and Cambodia?\nFinally, judging by the intense scrutiny that comes for a candidate and his or her entire family would any fully sane person ever run for President of the United States?\nWe can't expect to come to any national agreement on most of the above examples. But at least they would be more productive than debating or pontificating on disputed Quote: s, leaks, and innuendo about any president's personal behavior.\nIt's bad enough that the coverage of every presidential campaign has become dominated by a focus on personality, poll numbers, and all things non-policy related. That's been a major complaint about the presidential election process ever since television played such a big role in John F. Kennedy's 1960 election victory.\nBut now we're seeing coverage of an actual presidency that's focusing mainly on the president's personality. That's dangerous.\nThis is true for both sides of the partisan aisle. For example, the GOP tax bill and its de facto repeal of Obamacare just passed and became law thanks greatly to the Democrats being distracted with non-policy matters like the Russia probe.\nMeanwhile, Republicans who support President Trump's policies are constantly forced to answer questions and criticisms based on his personal behavior. But all this amounts to is an enormous head fake.\nThat's because the hard fact is that President Trump's policies, executive orders, and the bills he's supported are no less sane than any of his predecessors' actual body of work. No matter how unprecedented and salacious the Quote: s in \"Fire and Fury\" are, they don't count as presidential policy. Presidential policy is not only objectively verifiable; it's the only presidential report card that matters.\nCommentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist.

Among other measures, the government has allocated subsidies and invested in infrastructure like charging stations.\nWhen state support for electric vehicle manufacturers was reduced last year, however, sales continued to remain robust as Chinese consumers appeared to warm to electric cars, according to The Wall Street Journal .\nGiven interest in the space, it's no surprise that China's electric car market is fairly crowded, with names like start-up Nio and leading local automaker BYD among those competing in the space. Even Tesla has a foot in the door, although it doesn't receive the same level of government support as local players.\nBut, according to Zhang, the segment targeted by WM Motor — electric cars priced in the \"affordable\" range of between 200,000 yuan ($30,764) and 300,000 yuan ($46,144) — is one that remains relatively unaddressed in the market.\nFor comparison, rival Nio's ES8 model priced at 448,000 yuan ($68,910) while Tesla's Model X went for around 836,000 yuan ($128,587) last month .\n\"The car industry is not a monopolized industry.

But most Americans who could benefit from them have never used them and most millennials in the red don't even understand how they work, according to a survey from CompareCards.com by Lending Tree . \nThe cards essentially let you move your credit card balance from a high-interest card to one that charges you no interest during a 0 percent introductory period, which typically lasts from six to 21 months, depending on the card. \n\"They can save you anywhere from hundreds to thousands upon thousands,\" Bruce McClary, the vice president of communications for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling , tells CNBC Make It . show chapters 10:18 AM ET Fri, 26 May 2017 | 00:58 \n\"The average household with revolving credit card debt pays $904 in interest a year,\" CNBC reports , citing a finding from NerdWallet. Using a balance transfer card, you temporarily escape those interest payments while you focus on getting out of the red. \n\"The goal is paying off the balance at the lowest possible interest rate without adding new debt back into the mix,\" says McClary. So make sure to first do the math. Figure out how much you need to pay each month to pay off your balance before the 0 percent introductory period is up. \nAccording to a study done by Consumer Intelligence, about a third of people with balance transfer cards fail to do this. That mistake could make your situation worse. Once the introductory period is up, the rate rockets to as high as 25 percent, reports WiseBread . \nAs a former credit counselor, McClary saw this firsthand. \"People took advantage of the balance transfer and ended up continuing their normal spending habits,\" he says. \"Instead of eliminating their debt, they essentially doubled it.\" \nTo ensure you're using a balance transfer card correctly, he also recommends avoiding making purchases with the card, because the 0 percent interest rate doesn't usually apply to new spending. show chapters 7:56 AM ET Mon, 24 July 2017 | 01:10 \nWhen you select a card, consider its one-time balance transfer fee, which ranges from 3 to 5 percent. If you have a large balance, you want to make sure what you will save outweighs that fee. \nAnd if you transfer the balance of multiple old credits cards, don't close them all at once, because that can hurt your credit score, says McClary. Waiting six months between each one you close is a good rule of thumb. \nUltimately, if used with the goal paying off your debt, balance transfer cards can be very effective. \nAnd, with debt hitting a record high in November, now could be an opportune time to try them. The federal funds rate also went up a quarter point last month. As CNBC reports , that hike will raise interest rates for people who carry a balance on their cards. \n\"Your debt will only grow faster and faster unless you take action,\" says Schulz.

He plans to reopen it this summer, around the same time the former Trump Taj Mahal casino will reopen nearby under the Hard Rock brand.\nThe former Revel will be called the Ocean Resort Casino. Deifik called the purchase \"a dream come true.\"\nBut the news raises a sobering question for a gambling resort that only recently regained its equilibrium following the shutdown of five of its 12 casinos: Might the sudden reintroduction of two large casinos create the same conditions that led to the wave of shutdowns in the first place?\nRevel's sale was finalized Thursday afternoon, during a blizzard, a fitting development for a project with a turbulent history. It cost $2.4 billion to build, yet lasted just over two years before shutting down, never having come close to turning a profit.\nDeifik is undeterred.\n\"We are incredibly excited that we were able to take advantage of the opportunity to acquire this tremendous property at a time when Atlantic City is seeing great economic strides,\" he said. \"The former Revel property opened at a time when Atlantic City was still in economic recovery, and operationally it just did not cater to the customer base for this destination.\"\nOne new amenity Deifik plans is a sports book facility that would operate if New Jersey wins its U.S. Supreme Court case to legalize sports betting.\nHe said the casino will employ 2,500 to 3,000 people. It has 1,399 hotel rooms. The gambling area will offer 100 table games and 2,200 slot machines.\nDeifik said he plans to bring back some of the restaurants that were popular at Revel, along with some new ones, including an Asian noodle bar. He also plans a high-end players' club.\nDeifik is president and CEO of Integrated Properties, which owns 103 commercial properties in five states, including the Hyatt Grand Champions Resort in Palm Springs, California, and several office and retail centers in the Denver and Phoenix areas.\nAnalysts are mixed on whether Atlantic City's seven operating casinos can handle two more competitors. Some say the reopenings could hurt smaller casinos and possibly lead one or more to close, but others are optimistic the new offerings — particularly the music-themed, globally known Hard Rock brand — can bring new customers who otherwise would not have traveled to Atlantic City.\nRevel opened in 2012, with no less an aim than to rewrite the rules of success in Atlantic City's casino market. It eschewed bus-riding, buffet-patronizing day trippers in favor of a hoped-for clientele of Wall Street traders, hedge fund execs and the highest of high-rollers. It was the only Atlantic City to ban smoking.\nNone of it worked.\nThe $13 million in casino winnings it took in its first month ranked it near the bottom of Atlantic City's 12 casinos — a spot it would occupy for its two-year existence. It went bankrupt twice, choking on massive debt it couldn't come close to paying, and closed on Sept. 2, 2014.\nStraub, a Polo-loving multimillionaire, bought it for $82 million from bankruptcy court and then fought with state officials over whether he needed a casino license. He said Monday he bought Revel \"to keep and not to sell.\" But he quickly tangled with government regulations at the local and state levels that he said frustrated his plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to help redevelop Atlantic City.\nStraub sold the property for $118 million more than he paid for it, but he incurred large expenses while keeping it closed.\nBut what Straub described as burdensome red tape are rules that all Atlantic City's other casino owners comply with. And a significant portion of his expenses involved legal fees incurred in fighting government regulations with which he disagreed.\nStraub said he retains more than 60 Atlantic City properties, with which he plans to \"be a spark for catalyzing positive economic movement in Atlantic City.\"\nThe closest he got to reopening Revel came with the partial installation of a rope-climbing course in what used to be the casino's port cochere area. But even that modest venture failed and was ripped out while half-finished.\nBefore settling on a reopened casino and hotel, Straub floated a wide variety of proposed uses for the property. They included a water park; condominiums; a health-themed spa; an equestrian facility; a so-called \"tower of geniuses\" where the world's top minds would gather to tackle society's problems, and a temporary home for Syrian refugees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T19:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T20:27:04.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They also want to be heard in the immigration debate since agriculture is struggling with a farm labor problem and relies on seasonal, foreign workers.\nAt the same time, farm incomes have come under pressure due to low prices for crops such as corn. And some fear federal budget cuts may impact the farm bill.\nDebate over the next farm bill is heating up and comes after Congress has held numerous hearings on the issue. Critics want to see cuts in subsidies and changes to crop insurance programs, and dairy and cotton farmers could see some of the biggest changes. The current farm bill is set to expire in September 2018.\nTrump is the first sitting president to address the U.S. farm group in 26 years, and he is scheduled to speak at 4 p.m. ET. The AFBF is the nation's largest agricultural group with around 1.5 million member families.\nMeantime, the sixth round of negotiations involving the North American Free Trade Agreement is set to begin Jan. 23 in Montreal. The U.S. has clashed with Canada on access to dairy and Mexico has been accused of abuses, such as \"dumping\" of certain specialty crops such as tomatoes.\nTrump has previously threatened to withdraw the United States from the 24-year-old trade pact with Canada and Mexico. But scrapping NAFTA without a replacement could be devastating to U.S. agriculture and end up costing American consumers more for their food, including Mexican-grown avocados used to make guacamole.\n\"The food chains of the three countries are very integrated, so without NAFTA it would have a massive displacement,\" said John Beghin, a professor of agricultural economics at North Carolina State University. \" Walmart or the other big retailers or food processors have spent time integrating across borders, so any change in trade policy will create headaches.\"\nOverall, Mexico and Canada represent nearly one-third of total U.S. agricultural exports. Corn, soybeans, fresh fruits and vegetables as well as livestock and dairy are major U.S. exports to those countries.\nU.S. agricultural exports in fiscal 2017 totaled $140.5 billion, up nearly $11 billion from the prior year. Canada was the second-largest ag export customer last year after China, with Mexico in third place , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nFor the Trump administration, though, concerns about NAFTA go well beyond agriculture to other industries such as auto manufacturing.\nAnother hot-button issue that may come up is immigration.\nThe ag industry claims they can't find enough American workers willing to harvest crops in fields and perform other farm work. Some farmers also say the immigration crackdown by the administration hasn't helped the situation and they worry that cutting off foreign-born workers will only worsen the farm labor shortage.\n\"Part of it is there is plenty of work, even for people in this country, but it's really difficult for citizens to see themselves working in a field,\" said Jim Durst, an organic farmer who grows squash, melons and other specialty crops in Yolo County in Northern California.\nDurst added that the continued pressure by the Trump administration on immigrants coming into the United States \"has exacerbated the problem by creating an atmosphere of fear.\" He also faults Congress for its failure to help on the issue.\nGrowers from California and other parts of the country have relied on a so-called H-2A visa program that allows agricultural guest workers to perform seasonal work. But agricultural employers say it's essentially created a \"mini-bureaucracy\" and added other burdens rather than eased the farm labor shortage.\nStill, one of the themes the president is likely to tout is progress his administration has made on the regulatory front to help ranchers and farmers.\nFor one, the Trump administration rolled back the so-called Waters of the United States rule, which was drafted during the Obama administration and broadened the definition of such things as \"tributary\" and also toughened controls over \"adjacent waters.\"\nAg groups claimed the new rules forced ranchers and feedlot operators to get permits or risk excessive penalties despite being miles away from any navigable water. Also, some ranchers said it restricted their ability to erect important structures including fences to keep in livestock.\nTrump also is likely to tout the new tax bill as it could lower rates for family farms structured as small businesses. Also, there are provisions that help farmers with expenses.\nFinally, the president may discuss how rural America is facing challenges with the opioid epidemic but how his administration declared it a \"health emergency\" and is tackling the issue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T21:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T21:53:12.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

CLF took in $26 million in 2017, compared with $497,000 in 2015, the previous year without an election. \nThe haul comes ahead of 2018 midterm elections in which majority House Republicans hope to limit potential losses partly driven by President Donald Trump 's low approval ratings. Democrats have led Republicans by more than 10 points in an average of recent ballots that ask voters to choose between a generic member of both parties in 2018, according to RealClearPolitics .\nThe party in control of the White House — in this case the GOP — has often struggled in its first congressional midterm election following a presidential race. \n\"CLF's record-setting off-year fundraising is a testament to Speaker Ryan's leadership and House Republicans' conservative agenda,\" Executive Director Corry Bliss said in a statement. \"Knowing history is against us, CLF's field program has laid the groundwork to protect the Republican House majority well ahead of Election Day, opening 27 field offices and making over 5 million voter contacts to date.\"\nPolitico first reported the groups' fundraising haul .\nBig-money donors in recent days have raised the stakes for the Nov. 6 elections, which will help to determine how much of the GOP's sprawling agenda it can pass while Trump is in office.

A special election there in March will determine who replaces Tim Murphy, who resigned from Congress in October. \nRepublicans hold a 239 to 193 seat advantage in the House.

PNC is also reporting earnings Friday after the bell, with options traders expecting an implied move of 3 percent for the name.\nFrom a technical standpoint, Carter Worth, chief market technician at Cornerstone Macro, sees trouble ahead in the space. The financials-tracking ETF ( XLF ) is up almost 2 percent since the start of the year and closed at its highest level since October 2007 on Friday. But Worth says it hasn't been the banks that have driven XLF to multiyear highs despite rallies in names like Bank of America and Wells Fargo, both up 2 percent since the start of 2018.\n\"But what's interesting is [XLF is] so dependent on names like American Express and big insurance companies like Travelers,\" he said Friday on CNBC's \"Options Action.\" \"The banks themselves have trailed the market, and regional banks have really trailed.\"\nTo illustrate his point, Worth brought up a chart of the KBW Bank Index , which includes both big banks and smaller regional names. While the index has rallied about 2 percent in the past month, Worth points out that the index is actually underperforming the S&P 500.\nIn fact, since the start of the year the KBW index has rallied almost 2 percent while the S&P has rallied about 3 percent.\nThe same can be said for big bank J.P. Morgan. The company's stock has made an impressive 10 percent comeback since the end of November. The rally was first fueled by the Nov. 28 hearing for Fed Chairman nominee Jerome Powell , where he said that bank rules were \"tough enough\" for a stable financial system, and then with the passage of the tax law and the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in December.\nBut despite the slew of good news for banks, Worth points out that J.P. Morgan has also been underperforming the market.\n\"[J.P. Morgan has] gone up of late, but it's not participating with the general market,\" he said. \"Overall, it has made no real relative results in about two years. So [J.P. Morgan], as a pick, really didn't do anything one could've done by just being in the SPY, and that's the issue,\" Worth said, referring to the S&P 500 ETF.\nIn conclusion, \"I don't want to be overweight banks here, and I don't think J.P.

Mueller III. \nPresident Donald Trump could be interviewed within weeks as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Washington Post reported on Monday. \nMueller raised the issue of interviewing Trump during a meeting in late December with the president's lawyers, John Dowd and Jay Sekulow, the Post said. The interview, which would deal with a limited portion of questions, could take place within the next several weeks, the Post said, citing a person close to the president. \nSekulow and Dowd did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the Washington Post report. White House attorney Ty Cobb declined to comment on it, saying it was policy not to comment on communications with the special counsel's office. \nEarlier on Monday, a source familiar with the issue said discussions about Trump's possible testimony have been going on among lawyers.

(There are some exceptions to the rule, as certain tumor viruses demonstrate-- see the sad, heroic tale of Nobel laureate Howard Martin Temin , who had the effrontery to challenge said dogma.) But while single-stranded RNA has never shared top billing on the biological marquee with its elegant, gyring, double-stranded relative, it just might hold the answer to some remarkable cures. That's because, in theory, thanks to that single wisp of intermediate code, the genes implicated in many diseases should be easier to quiet.\nOne way to shut down the communication link is through a snippet of RNA called \"antisense\"--which binds to the messenger RNA (a \"sense\"-making strip of nucleic acids) that is transcribed by a given stretch of DNA. In short, when antisense RNA matches up with and binds to messenger RNA (mRNA), or to a precursor strand called pre-mRNA, it stops the latter from conveying the instructions for making proteins. (There's also a separate, related, strategy called RNA interference , or RNAi, which typically relies on one of two types of tiny RNA molecules --either small (or short) interfering RNA or microRNA --to silence genes. The journal Nature Reviews Genetics has a terrific animated video explainer here .)\nThe notion that antisense oligonucleotides might inhibit the progression of genetic diseases or tumor-causing viruses dates back to the late 1970s , when legendary molecular biologist Paul Zamecnik and colleague Mary Stephenson demonstrated the method's viability against the Rous sarcoma virus. And it's been one of those ideas that has excited--and taunted--researchers and drug developers ever since: one that, at the same time, is brilliantly intuitive and agonizingly hard to make work.\nThough hailed as \" a new therapeutic principle \" in 1990, it nonetheless took another eight years for the FDA to approve the first antisense drug, fomivirsen --for the treatment of AIDS-related retinitis caused by human cytomegalovirus. The next antisense agent to earn approval didn't get that nod until a decade and a half later, in 2013. That was for mipomersen , a medicine used to treat familial hypercholesterolemia , a hereditary condition that causes massive increases in LDL cholesterol. The hope was that antisense oligos for everything from cancer to HIV would roll off the pharmaceutical assembly line--but despite a generation of valiant effort, the successes on this front have been meager .\nNow, it looks like the tide may at last be turning. In recent months, there have been promising results in RNA-targeting drugs for some rare neurological disorders .\nAnd the reports from one early (Phase 1/2a) clinical trial of an antisense oligonucleotide called IONIS-HTT Rx , made by California biotech Ionis Pharmaceuticals , suggest that this approach might one day stop Huntington's disease --a cruel, progressive, and ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disorder. Huntington's is caused by an inherited mutation in a gene called HTT , which encodes for a toxic protein that destroys brain neurons--damage that, over time, can severely limit a person's ability to walk, talk, swallow, or even think clearly. As with functional genes, the aberrant Huntington's gene sends its protein-coding instructions by way of a messenger: RNA. And in the recent randomized study--which was designed to assess the safety and tolerability of various doses in volunteers from Canada, Germany, and the UK-- IONIS-HTT Rx appeared to substantially block the gene's pernicious message from getting through. The experimental drug, according to reports , sharply reduced the cell-killing protein in the subjects' nervous systems and apparently had no major side effects . (The results have yet to be published.)\nThe gene-silencing strategy, in the form of RNA interference, has also showed promise against an uncommon neurodegenerative disease called hereditary ATTR amyloidosis , as my colleague Sy Mukherjee wrote about in Fortune 's year-end Investor's Guide . Alnylam Pharmaceuticals , based in Cambridge, Mass., has so far spent 15 years developing patisiran , an investigational RNAi drug for hATTR--and this past November, at a scientific meeting in Europe, the company presented Phase 3 trial results that appeared to blow the research community away. The FDA, for its part, seems excited, too; shortly after the study presentation, it granted patisiran \" Breakthrough Therapy Designation \" status--a promise that the agency will expedite its review of the drug if and when it's submitted for approval.\nToday, there are a fair number of gene-silencing drugs in late-stage development and dozens of companies working in the space--and it feels like we could be close to a tipping point.\nHuman biology, of course, has a way of teasing and fooling those who try to solve its mysteries--so the latest upbeat findings may be yet another false harbinger of success. Nonetheless, I'd bet on this trend in 2018 and beyond. It just makes good antisense.\nThis essay appears in today's edition of the Fortune Brainstorm Health Daily.

I believe this is going to open the door to an inverted yield curve, wherein the longer-dated Treasuries carry a lower yield than those that are shorter-dated; this development is classically taken as a troubling signal for the broader market. \nIndeed, we have already seen a stunning flattening in the yield curve as measured by the spread between the 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields. Furthermore, the 10-year yield has failed to take its high from the first quarter of 2017, and the 30-year has remained even more contained in its moves. \nUltimately, these long periods of muted moves will lead to a mean reversion.

At this point, I anticipate volatility will pick up in the coming months and that the 30-year Treasury prices will rally at a faster clip than the shorter-end — the 2- and 5-year Treasury yields. \nThink about it this way: As prices in the 30-year rise, the yields in the 30-year will sink. As the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy, the shorter-dated bond yields will go through their own periods of containment. Theoretically, this should encourage the 30-year Treasury yield to fall beneath that of the 2- and 5-year. \nSo, how should investors position themselves if we are expecting this kind of price action across the bond market? \nInvestors ought to sell three 5-year Treasury futures contracts for every one 30-year Treasury futures contract bought.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T13:56:13.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Morgan and Wells Fargo kick off big bank earnings this week, potentially fueling more gains for the stock market or putting a wrench in this record-making stretch. \nBut forget the short-term noise, the Vertical Group analyst said Tuesday, the bank rally could be explosive this year. \n\"Who cares what happens in the fourth quarter? It's ancient history,\" Bove said Tuesday on CNBC's \" Trading Nation .\" \"What we care about is if we get this investment banking thing going, if we get these loans happening, banks will make a lot of money in 2018.\" \nThe key to industry activity this year will be investment banking, which Bove predicts will see a sharp pickup. The reason is twofold: well-known unicorns such as car-hailing service Uber could float their shares and public companies could bring more stock to market, both stemming from current enthusiasm for equities. \nOn top of the predicted recovery in investment activity, banks currently have a lot of liquidity to work with. That will only support earnings should the U.S. economy improve as expected. \n\"These banks are sitting with a massive amount of underutilized earning capacity,\" said Bove, calculating $3.7 trillion in the banking sector that is currently available. \"If the economy were to rise with any degree ... that liquidity would be put to work and bank earnings would go up very sharply in 2018.\" \nGoldman Sachs could be the best of the bunch, said Bove, as it is perfectly poised to benefit from a revival in investment banking and trading. Vertical Group rated Goldman as a sell for most of 2017, but switched it to a buy on the firm's sunny outlook for investment and trading activity. \nGoldman's stock was the worst performer of the major banking and investment companies in 2017, clocking a 6.4 percent gain for the year. That was slightly less than the 10 percent rise by shares of Wells Fargo but a fraction of the gains of more than 20 percent seen by Citigroup , JPMorgan, Bank of America , and Morgan Stanley . \nBefore a possible 2018 earnings surge, fourth-quarter results will be dissected and the major banks are likely to see the same problems that hounded the industry over the first three quarters of 2017. Bove noted weak trading, soft loan volume and little benefit from the Federal Reserve 's rate increases as possible pressures on earnings in the recent quarter. \n\"The net of it is most of the earnings improvements [that] will occur will be in keeping costs down, keeping loan losses down and therefore, you'll get a slight improvement in earnings but nothing exciting,\" he said. \nBanks are set to report for the fourth quarter at the end of this week and the next. BlackRock, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Wells Fargo are scheduled for Friday. Next week, Citigroup is slated for Tuesday, Bank of America and Goldman on Wednesday, and Morgan Stanley on Thursday.

Anytime bitcoin is mentioned, it is expressed in U.S. dollar terms. Rick Findler | PA Images | Getty Images A customer uses a Bitcoin machine in Piccadilly Circus in London. \nWith cryptocurrencies still in the news, tumbling 10 percent to 20 percent in recent days thanks in part to a change in calculating how the coins are valued, the debate rages on as to whether bitcoin , ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and litecoin are, in fact, money. \nThe Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, said on CNBC W ednesday morning that the speculation in bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, \"will have a bad ending.\" \nAppropriately, dogecoin, a digital currency that began as a joke based on an internet meme, has risen sharply in recent days and hit a total value of $2 billion. By Wednesday it had retreated to a market value of about $1.5 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. \nBut rather than seeing all these digital currencies as a small part of a larger system known as blockchain, I am predisposed to view them as just speculative tokens in a cryptocurrency bubble that has inflated more quickly than any other in financial market history. \nAdmittedly I'm green with envy for failing to foresee the explosive rally in the price of bitcoin when it was first brought to my attention several years ago. \nHaving said that, there are many things I find quite ironic about how bitcoin and other \"cryptos\" are described. \nFirst, they are largely denominated, or discussed, in U.S. dollar terms. \nIf, however, you are buying and selling these currencies on the various exchanges, then, generally speaking, the currencies trade against one another. \nBitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum or litecoin, are cross-traded, just like on traditional foreign exchange markets, where dollars are priced in value against yen, euros, Swiss francs or Chinese yuan. \nThese exchanges are easy to pull up on a computer screen but not that easy to use. It's much easier to buy and sell dollars, stocks or commodities than it is to trade bitcoin and its brethren. \nThe conversion of one crypto to another is relatively easy on these embryonic exchanges. But getting your digital wealth converted into cold hard cash is more problematic. \nIf the dollar is archaic, as the crypto-enthusiasts believe, why not speak only in crypto-terms? \nBecause the dollar remains the reserve currency of the globe. Its usage remains widespread, accounts for roughly 65 percent of all global economic transactions. \nIn the U.S. alone, one of the broad gauges of the nation's money supply, known as M2, totaled nearly $14 trillion as of December 2017. And that doesn't count even broader measures of the U.S. money supply and the dollar-denominated accounts held all around the world. \nNor does it count the tens of trillions of other sovereign currencies sloshing around the globe, all readily convertible to one another. \nThe total market value of all cryptocurrencies is roughly $600 billion, give or take a hundred billion. And while the growth has been impressive, it remains very difficult to walk into any establishment and exchange a digital token for goods or services. Founders' Worth Measured in U.S. Dollars \nInterestingly, also, is the fact that the founders of cryptocurrencies and other early entrants into the field, some of whom have been named among the wealthiest people in the world, talk about their worth in dollars, not digital coins. \nYou rarely, if ever, hear anyone say how many bitcoin they own. If they disclose that information at all, they talk about the dollar value of their holdings. \nCryptocurrency wealth is valued in dollars, isn't that ironic? \nThe Winklevoss twins are said to be the first bitcoin billionaires in history, for example. \nI understand that the entire development of this ecosystem is new, hence the need to compare it to existing forms of money. And, yes, 10 or 20 years from now, dollars may be obsolete and bitcoin could be the world's reserve currency. \nAchieving that goal may be quite hard. There have been only a handful of generally accepted forms of reserve currency in modern economic history — gold, the British pound sterling, very briefly, the French franc, and, of course, the U.S. dollar. \nIt strikes me as quite concerning that exchanges that have begun trading bitcoin derivatives settle their contracts in cash. And there exchange traded funds, or ETFs, that dabble in digital currencies coming soon to a market near you. \nRather interestingly, holders of digital derivatives do not take delivery in bitcoin, as you might gold, silver, or stocks. They cash out in dollars. It's like using tokens in a slot machine that will pay out in cash, or scrip, if you happen to win a potful. \nThis, of course, is not required when you buy a good or service with a U.S. dollar. The dollar is simply exchanged for the comparable value of goods and services and, whiles taxed as a retail sale; there is no profit or loss shown. \nUnderstanding of the history of money, the language associated with it, and how much time it takes for a currency to become generally acceptable has a very long tail. \nThe adoption of cryptocurrencies as a global source of funds has a long way to go before staking a claim to the world's economy. \nAnd unless, or until, the world starts transacting and measuring wealth in some alternative currency, the crypto-critics will likely have the upper hand, even if they haven't played that hand terribly well to date. \nAs a long-term investor, Buffett told CNBC he would be glad to buy five-year \"puts\" (downside bets) on all of the cryptocurrencies.

Instead, the administration sent Davos regular Anthony Scaramucci to represent the incoming administration in a relatively muted role. \nBut now it's 2018. Populist leader and advisor Steve Bannon is gone at the White House. A pro-business tax reform bill has been passed. President Trump is cheering and taking credit for the stock market rally on a near-daily basis. \nThis announcement seems right in line with the purge of the Bannon influence in the Trump administration. The president may now feel like it's time to play a more traditional and established role. After almost a year of playing the outsider, perhaps he's now ready to mingle with the world's top CEOs and political leaders to talk business, trade deals and security. \nBut there's just as much evidence that this will not be some kind of \"make nice\" visit. \nThe Trump administration is still about to announce new tariffs on some Chinese imports in a continuing effort to achieve what President Trump calls \"fair trade.\" With that in mind, President Trump could just as well be looking to go to Davos as more of a conqueror and proceed to bluntly tell off the assembled visitors about a number of issues. \nThat's precisely what he did at the NATO summit last May. He insisted that the European NATO members could and should spend more on defense and it apparently worked. \nThe Trump administration has also made no indication that it will reverse its decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. Climate change has long been a cause celebre at Davos. \nSo there's a good chance that President Trump's decision to go to Davos is less about a polite joining of the establishment elite and more about telling it off. \nObviously, there's a happy medium here. President Trump doesn't need to be rude when and if he makes his case for better European border security and handling of the Islamic refugee/migrant issue. He doesn't need to angrily call China a trade manipulator right to the Chinese leaders' faces. He doesn't have to taunt foreign countries over the fact that so much U.S. corporate cash is expected to flow back to America thanks to the new tax rates. \nBut he can make all of those points clearly and without apology in the way President Ronald Reagan used to encourage Europe to stand up to the old Soviet Union. He can insist there is a humane way to deal with the refugee crisis without keeping the borders wide open. He can make the case that there is a way to enact fairer trade deals. \nFinally, there's the current elephant in the room. The release of Michael Wolff's new book \"Fire and Fury\" has tongues wagging all over the world about President Trump's fitness for office . In this environment, what better way to fend off such talk than by sending President Trump to rub elbows and speak publicly and clearly about burning economic and political issues? \nThe more he is seen with his international peers, the better and more competent President Trump looks to the world. Trump still considers himself a businessman, so it would be a more comfortable venue for him than a purely political forum. \nThe fact is President Trump's previous international visits have worked out just fine for him. His trip to Saudi Arabia to push for real reforms in that country's approach to terrorism and its own internal governance definitely yielded results. His trip to Europe in the spring of last year did lead to more NATO member defense spending. \nThat track record and the current political climate make a Trump appearance at Davos a very easy decision to make. As long as he doesn't suddenly change his public persona during the forum, it will boost his image as a president engaged with the world and one who is willing to change course over time. \nCommentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist.

He sneaks glances at his phone in class. At night he stays up, his eyes glued to the currency's wild swings.\n\"I don't like how often it's on my mind,\" McGrath said. \"It's unhealthy.\"\nOwning a currency that some people say is a fraud and others say is the future can be an emotionally intense experience.\nWhen bitcoin lost 30 percent of its value on Dec. 22, for example, one post on Reddit read: \"I just re-financed my house to get in. I'm freaking out.\" Another user offered support to the frantic: \"If anyone's actually depressed or suicidal, come to r/SuicideWatch . We love to listen and talk there.\"\n\"I don't like how often it's on my mind. It's unhealthy. \" -Luke McGrath, Bitcoin investor It's the 24-hour cycle of cryptocurrencies that can wear on people's nerves, said Jim Smigiel, CIO of absolute return strategies at SEI Investments Co.\n\"With other speculative investments, like private equity and venture capital, you can't check your phone every five minutes,\" he said. With cryptocurrencies, \"You're able to track the minute-by-minute value of it.\"\n\"Looking at something with such high volatility all the time is not conducive to an investor's mental health,\" Smigiel said.\nHere's how to keep calm on the cryptocurrency roller coaster:\nLook away Bitcoin's volatility is part of what makes it irresistible , said Willemien Kets, associate professor at the University of Oxford's Department of Economics.\n\"We know from social psychology that the best way to get people hooked on something is to give them a reward on a very uncertain time frame,\" Kets said.\nDon't fall into the trap. C hecking the value of cryptocurrencies constantly is unproductive, Kets said.\n\"You can't do anything about the price movement itself,\" she said.\nInstead she recommends people decide on a price point at which they'll sell — say, if the asset drops below $10,000 — and set their phone to alert them at that threshold.\nJack Tatar, co-author of \"Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond,\" pointed to another reason why constant phone checks are futile.\n\"It's very hard to realize the gains you see on your phone,\" Tatar said. \"These markets are not as liquid as the stocks and bond market. You can check your phone and see you're up to $30,000, but if you wan't to realize that gain, you probably won't be able to do that.\"\nThat's because it can take days for a cryptocurrency transaction to complete, during which the value can change substantially. Despite his advice, Tatar admitted he, too, can't look away.\n\"My son has tried to tell me to take a few days off,\" he said. \"But I just can't.\"\nshow chapters Pot, bitcoin, Micron all speculative 20 Hours Ago | 01:08 Buy to hold When people buy and sell in a dizzied cycle, they miss the bigger picture of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology on which it's traded, said financial advisor Ric Edelman, founder and executive chairman of Edelman Financial Services.\n\"There's no question that digital currencies are the future,\" Edelman said. \"You should be prepared to own it for years.\"\nHe said his decision to hold bitcoin for more than a decade has paid off.\n\"I've watched it go from $1 to $1,000, back to $200 and then to $16,000,\" he said.\nAlthough he acknowledged that such ups and downs are intolerable for some people.\n\"If owning this asset is causing you to stare at the ceiling at night, you shouldn't own it,\" he said. \"There's more to life than money.\"\nPeter Ayton, who studies behavioral decision theory at the City University of London, said it's hard to expect people to be rational with cryptocurrencies. Many people who've been seduced by bitcoin are individuals who might not fully understand what they're buying, he said.\n\"When you have something as volatile as bitcoin, it doesn't lend itself to long-term strategic thinking,\" Ayton said.\nDiversify beyond bitcoin Michael Sonnenshein, investments director at cryptocurrency firm Grayscale, said people might be less anxious if they're not banking on just one cryptocurrency.\nFortunately, you don't have to: There are currently some 2,000 cryptocurrencies to chose from. And more investment firms are looking into establishing index funds for cryptocurrencies. For example, Grayscale is soon launching a \"basket of digital currencies,\" in which investors' money will be spread across five digital currencies.\n\"I've watched it go from $1 to $1000, back to $200 and then to $16,000.\" -Ric Edelman , financial advisor Diversifying is useful for another reason, Edelman said: \"It's so early, we don't know which cryptocurrencies will survive.\"\nInvest only what you can afford to lose Tatar said people must restrict how much of their investments go to cryptocurrencies.\n\"You're seeing too many people jumping in and betting the ranch, and just saying 'yee-haw!'\" he said. \"They're not disciplined enough to realize they have to stay within their asset allocation models.\"\n\"Re-balancing\" your investments is essential with cryptocurrencies, he said, because of their tendency to rapidly change value.\n\"If you've invested 20 percent of your portfolio into bitcoin, and all of a sudden you check and, lo and behold, your bitcoins have increased so much that they're now 35 percent of your portfolio, you can rebalance and go back to your asset allocation,\" Tatar said. \"That should protect you from some of that volatility.\"\n\"You're seeing too many people jumping in and betting the ranch, and just saying Yee-Haw!\" -Jack Tatar , co-author of of Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond It's not just the owners of cryptocurrencies who are stressed, Smigiel said. Recently, he finds himself consoling his clients who haven't bought any bitcoin, ripples or ethereum.\n\"We also see anxiety on the flip-side — the people who feel they are missing out,\" he said. \"And so you're anxious either way.\"\nMore from Personal Finance:\nBitcoin, once 'sketchy,' becomes more mainstream\nSome cryptocurrency-backed debit cards dropped from Visa network, leaving users scrambling\nBitcoin is too risky to treat as a 'serious' investment, financial advisers say", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T19:09:06.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We have a 28-year-old millennial mom customer who's pushing us from a digital point of view even faster than we can push ourselves,\" Elfers told \" Mad Money '\" Jim Cramer. \"You look at some of the other traditional retailers or traditional department stores, they have a much older core customer.

In 2018, e-commerce sales would climb to almost 23 percent, she told Cramer.\nAnother understated tailwind for the retailer could come from stabilizing birth rates in the United States, the CEO said, speaking from ICR's annual investment conference.\nBirth rates, which had been dropping since the 2008 financial crisis, started to curb their losses in 2016, a sign that they might reverse in 2017 and rise in 2018, Elfers said.\nAnd it's not just the physical customers that count to Elfers; she hoped younger generations' tech-y habits would help make the No. 1 children's specialty apparel retailer in North America the No. 1 children's specialty apparel retailer in the world.\n\"When you think about the Gen Z customer that's coming up, she's already shopping or he's already shopping in our stores with their mom,\" the CEO said. \"In 10 years from now, you can imagine how savvy they'll be digitally.

The Sapphire Gentleman's Club, a strip club right off Vegas's main drag, paid to showcase the robots as a way to drum up interest from press and customers.\nAs a first-time CES attendee, the gimmick worked on me: What could be more CES than pole-dancing robots?\nThe robots were as advertised: They gyrated on a stripper pole to music from 50 Cent and Pharrell, with dollar bills scattered on the stage and the floor. A half-dozen human dancers, most of whom were dressed in tight, shiny robot costumes, repeatedly took pics in front of their metallic colleagues. (The woman greeting guests as I walked in told me that I missed a skit where the human dancers unveiled the robot dancers to Star Wars music, and then joked about them stealing their jobs.)\nThe robots look nothing like actual humans, thank God. They had CCTV security cameras for faces, and you could see their metal interiors and wires as they moved up and down the pole. (They were, however, wearing high heels.)\nshow chapters Take a home tour with a robot 3:46 PM ET Mon, 18 Dec 2017 | 01:08 And unlike many of the big tech gimmicks you'll hear about this week from CES, the robot pole-dancers aren't courtesy of a massive multibillion-dollar corporation. They're the work of an artist named Giles Walker, a 50-year-old Brit who describes himself as a scrap metal artist with a passion for building animatronic robots. One of his other projects, The Last Supper, features 13 robots interacting around a table.\nWalker says he got the idea for pole-dancing robots more than seven years ago, when he noticed the rise of CCTV cameras being used as a way to surveil people in Britain for safety purposes, what he called \"mechanical peeping Toms.\" He was inspired by the idea of voyeurism, or watching others for pleasure, and decided to try and turn the cameras into something sexy on their own.\n\"There's a challenge,\" he said from a back table at the Sapphire Club, his robotic creations gyrating some 30 feet away. \"I think if you're a painter, you might want to paint a beautiful woman and make it beautiful. I'm a sculptor, and I wanted to do something that was sexy.\"\nHis robots have become a hit, and not just at CES ( this viral tweet from December certainly helped).\nWalker says he'll rent them out for corporate parties — usually \"full of men in shirts,\" he says — and referred to the robots as his \"Christmas jingle,\" which help pay the bills in a profession where money isn't always easy to come by.\nBut while pole-dancing robots might have been just a silly side effect of CES a few years ago, tech's recent grappling with the industry's obvious issues of sexism and gender disparity now put stripper robots in a very different light. CES has already been called out for a lack of gender diversity, and some see dancing robots as yet another example of an chauvinist industry lacking self-awareness.\nshow chapters Meet the robot butler who lives in this luxury L.A. high-rise 2:45 PM ET Thu, 7 Dec 2017 | 01:04 Walker, for his part, sees different concerns with his creations. The rise of human-like robots is coming, he says, and bringing them into the sex industry will be particularly problematic.\n\"They will invent the sex robot,\" Walker said. \"Everyone's striving to do it. I've been approached as well, but I think it's a really dark area. I'm loath to go there.\"\n\"My worry is — and this is really crude, but it is a crude idea — if you build a robot that you can have sex with, then you can build a robot that you can rape, and you can build a child robot that you can have sex with, and it's all supposedly legal,\" Walker continued. \"But [just] because it's legal, does that mean it's a healthy thing? The dark side of the sex industry will create some really nasty, nasty stuff, and I think, 'Is it worth it?'\"\nWalker is now dealing with the reality that his creations are indeed associated with sex, and while he may not like where the industry is headed, it can be difficult to get out altogether.\n\"I didn't build these to get involved in the sex industry. They weren't about sex, they were about voyeurism,\" he added. \"I've been dragged into this side of things unintentionally, but I'm not complaining. It does pay the bills. I am a robot pimp in that way.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T05:43:44.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Timothy Snyder is following his best-selling \"On Tyranny,\" a brief handbook about signs of authoritarianism, with \"The Road to Unfreedom: Russia, Europe, America.\" Snyder is a history professor at Yale University and his new book looks at threats to democracy in the U.S. and overseas.\n\"For me at least the point of 'On Tyranny' was to get ahead: knowing what we know of the past, we have to act quickly in the present,\" Snyder wrote in a recent email. \"In the next book, I try to show us our own moment in history, so that we see what we treasure by observing how it is attacked. The point of 'Road to Unfreedom' is responsibility: as we act to preserve threatened political virtues, we make ourselves into the kinds of citizens who can make a better future.\"\nLabeling a \"resistance\" book can be as challenging as defining the resistance movement. Disdain for the president is the unifier for authors who might otherwise have little to say to each other, from Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Khan-Cullors, whose memoir \"When They Call You a Terrorist\" is due this month, to Frum, a former George W. Bush speechwriter; to author-journalist Sarah Kendzior, a prominent commentator on authoritarianism whose 2015 e-book \"The View from Flyover Country\" is being reissued this spring in paperback.\n\"I think a diverse resistance is a positive force,\" Kendzior wrote in a recent email. \"Everyone has different insights on how the situation happened and how inhumane and unconstitutional policies can be stopped. This doesn't mean we have to agree about everything — I'm sure we don't — but we can agree we do not want an American autocracy.\"\nHarvard law professor and former Obama administration official Cass R. Sunstein has edited \"Can It Happen Here: Authoritarianism in America,\" essays by a diverse range of scholars on American democracy. The book was clearly inspired by Trump, but Sunstein said he doesn't consider it a work of \"resistance.\" He calls it an \"exploration of self-government\" touching upon currents events and such historical moments as the internment of Japanese during World War II.\nTrump opponents have been enjoying \"Fire and Fury,\" Michael Wolff's explosive tell-all about the administration that became an immediate best-seller. But booksellers hesitate to put it in the \"resistance\" category. At Unabridged Books in Chicago, owner Ed Devereux says that the book has been placed in a more traditional setting, new nonfiction.\n\"I don't think you're going to read that book to learn how to resist, or think of ways to deal with the political system,\" he said. \"It's just a best-seller.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T16:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T17:02:28.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They also express doubt whether the U.S. Congress would approve such a move. \nCanada and Mexico have rejected most of the U.S. proposals for NAFTA reforms, leaving officials with a big job if they are to bridge the large differences at the Jan. 23-28 talks in Montreal.

Bush administration.\nDuring his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee , Azar said in some circumstances it does make sense for the government to seek volume discounts for a health emergency.\n\"If the government is the purchaser, let's say for instance, we are going to be buying (drugs) as part of the opioid crisis program, and we're directly buying that and supplying it out to states and first responders, there's absolutely nothing wrong with the government negotiating that,\" he explained.\nBut when it comes to allowing the Medicare program to negotiate drug prices, that's where Azar splits with Trump. Under current law, private Medicare Part D drug plans administered by insurers do negotiate drug discounts, but the traditional Medicare program is prohibited from doing so.\n\"For the government to negotiate … we would have to have a single national formulary that restricted access to all seniors for medicines,\" he explained, noting that was the conclusion reached by the Congressional Budget Office under the Obama administration. \"That would be only thing that could change. I don't believe we want to go there in restricting patient access.\"\nUsing formulary plans that favor some drugs over others is how insurers, large employers and pharmacy benefit management firms secure deep discounts from pharmaceutical firms.\n\"For Medicare negotiating to work, they would have to say that some drugs are not available because they are too expensive, effectively creating a single set of drugs available for the elderly,\" said Craig Garthwaite, the director of Northwestern University's Kellogg's Health Enterprise Management Program. \"Frankly, that doesn't appear to be something that Americans are prepared for at this point.\"\nIn a heated exchange with democratic Senator Claire McCaskill , D.-Mo., Azar argued that the government would not be able to get any better pricing than private insurers and pharmacy benefit managers do for Medicare drug plans.\n\"But they're getting paid to do that. The government could do it directly … wouldn't that save us money?\" McCaskill countered.\n\"They do it better than the government would,\" Azar maintained.\n\"To his point, it is complicated to negotiate — there are so many drugs on the market, you'd literally have to have a contract for every drug on existence,\" said Les Funtleyder, a health care portfolio manager at E Squared Capital Management.

But strategists say the BOJ is not ready to move away from its easy ways yet, and that it was largely a technical move. The yen jumped and bond yields rose on the move, including the U.S. 10-year since a move away form easy policy in Japan could move global interest rates higher. SHARES Kim Kyung-Hoon | Reuters Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda gestures during a news conference at the BOJ headquarters in Tokyo, Japan November 1, 2016. \nThe Bank of Japan is seen as the last grown-up in the room actively filling the global liquidity punch bowl with both hands. \nThat's why a slight tweak to its bond buying program caused a flurry across financial markets Tuesday, sparking speculation it was joining the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank in cutting back on asset purchases, a move that could ultimately help drive up global interest rates. \nOn Tuesday, the BOJ modestly trimmed its purchases of Japanese government bonds by about $10 billion in the 10- to 25-year maturities and another $10 billion in maturities of more than 25 years. The yen jumped about a half percent to about 112.60 to the dollar, and bond yields rose. The U.S. 10-year yield also moved higher, breaking above 2.50 percent to a March high. Meanwhile, the slow-moving 10-year JGB yield barely budged, hovering around 0.07 percent. \nBut some strategists say while the BOJ may have sent a powerful signal, it in fact is just acting on a technicality that comes with changes it made to its bond purchase program back in 2016. Unlike the U.S. and Europe, where central banks have targeted the balance sheet size, the Japanese central bank is targeting interest rates and its purchases are based on prices. \n\"I think it's too early to proclaim the easy conditions in Japan are over. That said, I do think it's constructive and it shows how sensitive the markets are to any potential change,\" said Greg Peters, senior portfolio manager at PGIM Fixed Income. \nThe Bank of Japan has been a poster child for central bank easing, taking its rates to negative levels and buying all types of assets, including stocks. \n\"They're still buying ETFs, J-REITs, corporate paper. They changed how they're easing , but they're still easing,\" said Marc Chandler, head of fixed income strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. \"I think the market is overinterpreting this, partly because of their positions. They're short yen. They're long euros. They're being squeezed on both legs today.\" \nThe Bank of Japan is still in full throttle easing mode, while the Fed and ECB and are slowing down their programs. The Fed is the furthest along, having hiked interest rates five times so far after taking them to zero in the financial crisis. The Fed is on track to raise interest rates at least three more times this year, and it is also moving to shrink its balance sheet by reducing purchases of securities to replace those that are maturing. \nThe ECB is not yet hiking rates and is still in the middle of quantitative easing, but it is slowing down its purchases fairly dramatically. As of last Tuesday, it cut back its asset purchases in half, and there's talk it could end the program later in the year. \nWhile its last to leave the party, a change in BOJ policies would be the most symbolic move yet that the extreme policies adopted in the global financial crisis are finally coming to an end, and the juice that helped push risk assets higher is being slowly withdrawn. \nChandler said the BOJ has made a point of saying it will continue to ease. \"The BOJ says 'we're going to be patient. We're going to be the last one out…[Prime Minister Shinzo] Abe told the Bank of Japan: 'please be patient,\" said Chandler. \nPart of the reason the speculation rolled so easily across markets is that Japanese wage data picked up, seen as a potential early inflationary signal. Base pay in November rose 0.4 percent year over year form 0.3 percent in October. Overtime pay rose 2.6 percent and bonuses jumped 7.5 percent. The overall cash earnings rose 0.9 percent, higher than expected and the best since July, 2016. \nThere also has been some expectations that this would be the year that the BOJ changes its position and moves to ending extreme easy policy. \n\"If long rates continue to move higher, and the BOJ follows this with a continued reduction in the pace of the purchases, then we know we're on to something. We're onto a potential change in monetary policy in Japan,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group. \"I think that is likely in 2018. Whether this is the beginning of it, we'll have to see. They have some cover too. They know that the Fed is going to do and they know what the ECB is doing. Does the BOJ want to be the outlier of temporary insanity when every other central bank is pulling back? They are the epitome of extremity in terms of monetary policy.\" \nPeters said the ECB is the bank to watch and it may in fact be more aggressively moving away from easy policies . \n\"They're actually talking up the unwinding of the program, which actually could do one of two things. It could either pull the market action forward around their actual tapering or it could just dampen the market reaction when they do taper,\" he said. \nAs for the U.S., he does not see a big move up in U.S. rates this year, in part because of the super low and negative rates in Europe and Japan. \"I still think the curve will flatten but there will be steepening events.

The bureau was more inclined to believe Steele's information, he said, \"because they had other intelligence that indicated the same thing, and one of those pieces of intelligence was a human source from inside the Trump organization.\" NBC News' Ken Dilanian later tweeted that the supposed walk-in source \"was a mischaracterization by Simpson of the Australian diplomat tip about Papadopoulis.\" Simpson touched on how the Trump Organization handles paying taxes: \"One of the things we found out was that, you know, when it comes to paying taxes, Donald Trump claims to not have much stuff. At least the Trump organization. So they would make filings with various state and local authorities saying that their buildings weren't worth much.\" Simpson discussed Trump's relationship with Sater: \"This was something he didn't want to talk about and testified under oath he wouldn't know Felix if he ran into him in the street. That was not true. He knew him well and, in fact, continued to associate with him long after he learned of Felix's organized crime ties. So, you know, that tells you something about somebody.\" Fusion GPS Joshua Levy claimed that someone died as a result of the dossier: \"Somebody's already been killed as a result of the publication of this dossier and no harm should come to anybody related to this honest work.\" Fusion GPS did not secure full access to Trump's tax returns, Simpson said: \"They were Trump properties and I believe we may have reviewed some public information about estate taxes and things like that. We didn't have access to his tax returns.\" Simpson said he only become aware of the infamous Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer when it was reported in the New York Times: \"I was stunned.\" Simpson had no \"factual reason to believe\" the Trump Tower meeting was a Russian attempt to make contact with the Trump campaign, but: \"You know, as a sort of question of counterintelligence and just general investigation of Russian methods and that sort of thing, I think that's a reasonable interpretation.\" Fusion GPS concluded that Trump \"exaggerated\" his properties' worth in legal filings — but that did not indicate or show connections to Russia: \"Not that I recall.\" Simpson said Trump's country clubs aren't making any money: \"They were not profitable entities. I don't specifically recall. I just remember that these were not doing very well and that he'd sunk a lot of money into them and he hadn't gotten a lot of money back yet.\" \nRead the full transcript here: \nThis story is developing.

In fact, Macron appeared as \"perhaps the leader of Europe at this very moment\" said Philippe le Corre, a research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School. \nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May , who herself has a China trip set for the end of January, continues to face questions about Brexit and her own leadership; Germany's Angela Merkel is struggling to form a coalition; and the U.S. is facing political turmoil under Donald Trump's administration. \nFor his part, Macron is \"clearly eyeing\" a \"special strategic partnership\" with China, said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at French bank Natixis, pointing to China's consumers grow hungrier for what France has to offer. \nDuring his campaign, the French leader took a \"slightly negative\" approach to China by pushing for a European-level investment protection agency, but that development seems to have lost ground, Garcia-Herrero said. \nInstead, Macron appears to be taking a different angle with China. \n\"Macron seems to have come to the realization that he had better be on the right side of the table under China's divide and conquer strategy in Europe, i.e. a more accommodating stance towards China,\" she wrote. \nAs much as Macron is wooing China, Beijing is also reaching out to Europe through its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative that aims to connect Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa with a vast logistics and transport network. \nFor China, France's pivot to closer ties could be beneficial for its overall standing in Europe: A \"divide and conquer\" strategy will help diversify its power, as sentiment toward the East Asian giant turns sour in Germany, Garcia-Herrero added. \nThat shift comes as China is now producing more of its own machinery and automobiles instead of importing them from countries like Germany — and it's now even competing with the European powerhouse in third markets, she said. Mark Schiefelbein | AFP | Getty Images French President Emmanuel Macron (L) and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands after a joint press briefing at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on January 9, 2018. Macron pursued business, downplayed deals \nOver his three-day visit, Macron pursued business interests with China, but he also pushed for a reciprocal trading relationship. \nThat came as many in Europe are debating about the implications of Chinese investments in the continent, particularly in infrastructure and higher technology. \n\"At the end of the day, Europe is very open. It's more open than the Chinese market itself. Reciprocity is the key word, really. That's what Emmanuel Macron was trying as a message to convey to [Chines President] Xi Jinping ,\" le Corre told CNBC. \nOn Tuesday, Macron offered to open France to Chinese investment in exchange for greater access to China's markets for French companies, Reuters reported . \n\"We have an access to markets which is unbalanced, unsatisfying,\" Macron told members of the French and Chinese business community at an event in Beijing, Reuters reported . \n\"If we don't deal with this responsibly, the first, natural, reaction will be to close up on both sides,\" he said. \"Let's open up both instead.\" \nOn Wednesday, Macron said a contract with China for 184 Airbus A320s would be finalized soon, Reuters reported. \nThe French leader downplayed the lack of other big deals during his visit, saying other countries had trumpeted big figures in the past that masked more modest realities. \n—Reuters contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T09:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T10:08:59.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The nation's money supply has been growing at a 6.4 percent clip for most of the past decade, yet the economy as measured by nominal gross domestic product has been growing at slightly less than 3 percent annually in the same period.\nThus, excess funds have been building in the banking system. Bank deposits have grown by 7.3 percent per year in the past decade, according to the Federal Reserve. However, since the economy is growing relatively slowly, the banks have failed to put a large portion of their new deposits to work.\nConsider this. At the end of 2017, banks had $13.2 trillion in deposits but only $9.6 trillion in loans. In fact, because the money supply kept growing and the economy did not keep pace, deposits grew by $5 trillion from 2007 to 2017. Yet, loans only grew by $1.9 trillion. So, at present, banks now have $3.66 trillion more in deposits than in loans. This is the biggest gap ever in these figures. To think of this another way, it is 7.6 times greater than this gap was in 2007, when it was only $476 billion.\nSince the banks cannot lend all of these deposits, and because there are high capital costs to keeping them, banks are paying below-market rates for the funds. My estimate, based on numbers from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, is that banks are paying between 50 and 60 basis points for funds today when the effective Federal Funds rate is 1.42 percent.\nIncreasing production More importantly, those shares being produced by the hypothetical company are up 18.4 percent, according to S&P. The differential between holding cash in the bank, or in many other places in the economy, relative to owning shares was substantial.\nThus, as Cramer has perhaps implied, the demand for shares outstripped the supply of this product.\nClassical economists would argue that when the price of a product rises sharply because demand is outstripping supply, the producer of the product will increase the supply. If we move from the hypothetical to a real-world application, the supply of shares can be increased if a number of companies make public offerings or existing firms complete secondary offerings, perhaps to repay their debt.\nInvestment banks, and the bottom line I strongly believe that 2018 will be a year when there is an explosion in new stock offerings, through either initial or secondary offerings. This will be a year when some unicorns go public. It will be a year when some companies swap their relatively high cost debt for low cost equity.\nThis will be a bonanza for investment bankers. This is because investment banking revenues will surge on the offerings, and the increase in investment banking will feed other businesses operated by those firms. Increased investment banking, furthermore, stimulates more loans, more trading, more customer activity and more asset gathering overall.\nInvestors should be aggressively buying stocks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to capitalize, as the imbalance between demand for shares and the supply of these units is addressed by the market.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

The company's global staffing lead and senior recruiter Lisa Stern Haynes says that the tech giant is able to employ the very best because a group of people have to agree on each person that's hired.\nA hiring manager can say no to an applicant for any reason, says Haynes. On the flip side, a hiring manager cannot single-handedly give the \"final yes\" to extend a job offer. All suitable candidates must be passed along to a hiring committee for review.\n\"When managers come to Google for the first time and hear this, especially after years and years of having it a very different way at their previous companies, they're shocked,\" says Haynes.\nBut the tech giant stands by its strategy of making hiring decisions through a team consensus. \"Research tells us that team's that have diverging opinions can make better less biased decisions. And that also applies to the way we make hiring decisions too,\" Haynes explains.\nThe senior recruiter admits that utilizing a hiring committee does slow down the hiring process, although this approach is beneficial for the company in the long run. Haynes explains that you often see employers rushing to settle for a candidate because of time pressure, or even hiring someone due to a preexisting relationship or as a favor to someone.\nThis can lead to a bad hire, which has a really \"long lasting negative effect on a team or a company's culture,\" says Haynes. \"It's way better to take the time and go through a very robust hiring committee on the front end and then identify the best possible candidate the first time around.\"\nThe hiring committees at Google are usually made up of leaders in the specific organization doing the hiring. Members serve on the committee for three to six months before being rotated out of the committee. However, the individual hiring manager is not part of the committee, which Haynes says new managers also find surprising.\nshow chapters Former Google career coach shares a visual trick for making the new year more productive and happy 11:27 AM ET Thu, 21 Dec 2017 | 01:03 Here's how hiring decisions are made, she says: The hiring manager first interviews the candidate and then fills out a hiring packet that includes things like the detailed interview feedback, the recruiter's notes from the initial conversation, internal references if the person knows someone at Google and external references if the person has submitted professional references.\nThe hiring manager then passes this review on to the independent committees. The best part of this chain, says Haynes, is that unlike the hiring manager, committee members are removed from the urgency of selecting someone and are able to judge the applicant based solely on merit.\n\"They're like a layer of objectivity and they're looking to see does this person match the qualification for this immediate role at hand,\" says the lead recruiter. \"Also, are they gonna be a good fit for the organization as a whole for the longer term,\"\nThis is particularly important for a company like Google in which employees jump from team to team and from role to role. In fact, Haynes says that the company values applicants who are problem-solvers and who have a \"general cognitive ability\" over role-related knowledge because positions are constantly shifting.\n\"If you think about how quickly Google changes, if you just hire someone to do one specific job but then our company needs change, we need to be rest assured that that person is going to find something else to do at Google,\" she says. \"That comes back to hiring smart generalists.\"\nLike this story?

Renovation spending is soaring, and 80% of borrowers taking out home equity lines of credit say they would consider using that money to renovate, according to a survey released in December by TD Bank. \"We're not only seeing more requests for proposals, but more committed projects from homeowners,\" said Steve Cunningham, a remodeler from Williamsburg, Virginia, in a report from the National Association of Home Builders. \"In addition to regular updates and repairs, there's been an uptick in more ambitious large remodel requests.\" Remodeling spending topped $152 billion in 2017, and renovations for owner-occupied single-family homes will increase 4.9% in 2018 over 2017, according to the NAHB. That does not include remodeling done by investors looking to flip or rent properties, both of which are increasing as well. \"Below-normal rates of home building are creating an aging housing stock,\" said Paul Emrath, vice president of survey and housing policy research at the NAHB. \"Factors inhibiting stronger growth include the ongoing labor shortage and rising material prices.\" An older housing stock, combined with not enough new homes being built, means more people will choose to renovate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T18:55:05.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

P. Morgan Chase on Jan. 1, 2006, and Lloyd Blankfein took the reins of Goldman Sachs just six months later. Both executives have successfully steered two of the world's most celebrated financial institutions through the most turbulent decade for banking since the 1930s.\nNow that the external environment is finally improving for their sector and their companies' respective share prices have responded accordingly, is it time for these executives to bow out on the perfect high? The median tenure of an S&P 500 CEO is just four years; these two have each been around for 12.\nAnd if they do decide now is the time, who are the leading contenders to replace them?\nIt is hard to decide who handled the 2008 financial crisis better.\nThe fact that Blankfein's Goldman, with a market value of $96 billion, was able to repay the U.S. government's \"bailout' funds in less than 12 months (funds which, to this day, they deny they ever needed) and then turn 2009 into a year of blowout profit relative to the industry raised his profile in the ranks of Goldman's greats.\nHe managed this feat even as the crisis claimed the stand-alone futures of other pure investment banks such as Lehman Brothers (which went bust), Merrill Lynch (which was acquired by Bank Of America) and Bear Stearns (which was acquired by J.P. Morgan).\nMorgan Stanley is the only true survivor alongside Goldman, and it took a change in CEO and major restructuring to try to catch up. Its share price still lags Goldman's from the pre-crisis peak.\nDimon's execution was also outstanding, particularly given that he took on two faltering banks in Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, increasing J. P. Morgan's already large exposure to the struggling housing market. The bank, which has a market value of $375 billion, emerged within a number of years with a \"fortress balance\" sheet.\nThe subsequent years of extreme regulatory hurdles, significant fines, and politically charged Congressional hearings may also have led to the departures of lesser leaders. But Dimon and Blankfein fought on in a way that Vikram Pandit of Citi, Ken Lewis of Bank Of America and John Mack of Morgan Stanley did not.\nIn the last seven years, Dimon's outperformance is hard to dispute. J. P. Morgan's share price is up 217 percent to Goldman's 67 percent. Both banks are preparing to report fourth quarter and year-end 2017 financial results in the coming days.\nThat said, it is important to highlight how impressive Blankfein's performance is relative to the rest of the pack. Goldman's stock is up 89 percent since he took over. Morgan Stanley is up 31 percent in the same period, while Bank of America and Citi are both down (Citi is still down some 83 percent despite its recent recovery). Indeed Blankfein's starting base was already high given that Goldman was up 130 percent from its 1999 IPO to the time Blankfein became CEO.\nComparing stocks (price moves June 2006 to January 9, 2018)\nBank of America -22.77 percent\nCiti -82.54 percent\nGoldman 88.88 percent\nJ. P. Morgan 232.52 percent\nMorgan Stanley 31.13 percent\nWells Fargo 151.04 percent\nTrading Difficulties The market share of some of Goldman's key businesses is another focus of comparison. From 2010 through the first three quarters of 2017, Goldman's share in stock trading fell to 15 percent from 19 percent, according to Instinet. In fixed income, share fell to 7.5 percent from 12 percent.\nJ.P. Morgan's share, on the other hand, rose to 13 percent from 11 percent in equities, and rose to 19 percent from 14 percent in fixed income.\nIndeed all of the major U.S. investment banks saw gains in share over that period apart from Goldman. The total share in all trading for the big five American investment banks rose to 58.2 percent last year from 47.2 percent in 2010.. That is a major blot on an otherwise impressive copy book for Blankfein.\nGoldman does remain the leading advisory firm, with 12.8 percent market share in banking compared to to J. P. Morgan's second-place 9.2 percent in the most recent quarter. But that is a smaller part of the pie. Trading remains the key for Goldman despite the recent issues. Some 37.5 percent of total revenue in the third quarter of 2017 came from trading compared to 21 percent for investment banking.\nThe only way Blankfein could plausibly face direct pressure from shareholders would be if the company was seen to be missing the recently announced $5 billion revenue growth target set out for the next three years.\nThe very specific forecast, which is rare for Goldman Sachs, came in September 2017 after two dire quarters' of performance. Most analysts agree that the targets are ambitious, and someone will have to take responsibility if they are missed. But that judgement will come in 2019 and 2020.\nDimon's scare Dimon's record since the financial crisis is of course not without its errors. Unquestionably the highest profile was the London Whale scandal in 2012 in which a rogue trader, Bruno Iksil, was able to lose a massive $6.2 billion before Dimon, his lieutenants and the company's risk management systems noticed.\nThe bank ended up paying a fine of $1 billion for violating securities laws, while Dimon was forced to take a pay cut. He maintains that the company itself was never at risk, but the pressure on him was immense at the time, and the firing of some lieutenants brought him to tears on one occasion. He said in an interview last August that Iksil was not the guy to blame.\nRegardless of their troubles, both men have the power to decide when it is time to go. This week, CNBC asked Dimon how many more years he wanted, and he said, \"I love our company and our people and being part of this outstanding team. I won't speculate on timing, and important to note that I serve at the pleasure of the Board.\"\nIt is a board he has shaped over the years and on which he serves as chairman, of course. But he claims that there is no other job in the world he would rather do.\nAt age 63, estimates for Blankfein's departure range from one to three years. For Dimon at 61, the top end is more like five years. The median age of an S&P CEO is 57, according to Equilar.\nBlankfein showed his determination to stay a year ago – when his long-time second in command, Gary Cohn, was offered a job at the White House. Sources say Cohn would have stayed at Goldman had he been promised the CEO role within in two years. Such a promise was not forthcoming from Blankfein.\nWho's next in line? So, while they are both still very much in control, the incentive to bow out for Blankfein a little sooner is higher.\nThe pressure on Dimon internally is also lower. His underlings are more relaxed about the immediate years ahead. At 59, Gordon Smith, CEO of J. P. Morgan's consumer and community bank, is the oldest of Dimon's direct reports. He would also be the most likely candidate to take over if Dimon were to leave tomorrow.\nBut those close to Smith say he does not have a big ego and is not itching to become CEO. Sources say he was consulted for the American Express CEO job late last year but turned it down quickly.\nDaniel Pinto, the 55-year-old head of investment banking, is also content where he is. His performance has been very strong, but he hasn't sought much public praise for it, and thus probably gets less attention than deserved.\nIn another three ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T03:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T03:44:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Sure enough, bitcoin rallied to a high near $19,800 in December, with its performance widely outpacing stocks. \nSince that high, however, the cryptocurrency has fallen 25 percent, trailing stocks, gold and oil, which are up a respective 3 percent, 5 percent and 10 percent during that period. \nDespite the drop, Lee is still pounding the table on the cryptocurrency. \n\"Even on a risk-adjusted basis, I think bitcoin is going to easily outperform the S&P,\" Lee said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Futures Now.\" \"On a long-term basis, [the easiest way to look at bitcoin is] as a replacement or a store of value,\" he said. \"So as millennials discover and generate income, they're going to use it as a replacement for gold.\" \nInvestors have quipped that the bitcoin boom could be taking market share from gold. Over the last year as bitcoin surged about 1,535 percent, gold has been tethered around the $1,300 level. \n\"If [bitcoin] gets 5 percent of the gold market, that's roughly $50,000,\" he added. That's a more than 200 percent move from where bitcoin is currently trading. \nOn a near-term basis, Lee expects bitcoin to reclaim its December high. \"We think that by mid-2018, we're going to be part of the way there, and that's why we get [bitcoin to $20,000],\" he said. \"If [bitcoin] can actually rise close to [that $20,000 level] in the first half of this year, I think in the second half of 2018, we'll see a move bigger than that,\" Lee said. \"So I think bitcoin is still something you should own [all year].\" \nDespite its underperformance in the past month, bitcoin is still up 15 percent in the first few days of 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T23:10:55.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The launch window opens at 8 p.m. Eastern U.S. time, or 5 p.m. Pacific. The rocket will be launching from Cape Canaveral in Florida. \nThe actual payload of the Zuma mission is essentially unknown. The Falcon 9 will carry a U.S. government satellite made by Northrop Grumman into low earth orbit. But no one knows what the satellite is for, or even what branch of the government is launching it. The launch also comes after a long delay, with the first attempts going way back in November . \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nOne other semi-mysterious detail about the Zuma mission is that it shares a name with Jacob Zuma, the President of South Africa. There’s been no official acknowledgment of a connection, though SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is originally from South Africa and moved to the U.S. as a teenager. Zuma is in the midst of a fight for his political life, as years of accusations of corruption have culminated in parliamentary efforts to remove him from power . \nAs one South African news outlet cheekily commented on the SpaceX launch, “some South Africans wouldn’t mind seeing Zuma blasted into space.” \nAssuming the Zuma launch goes smoothly, things should get a lot more exciting for SpaceX by the end of the month. That’s the current general window for the first live test launch of the Falcon Heavy , a massive rocket designed to carry humans into space, and which marks the first stage of Musk’s plan to colonize Mars . Musk has opined, however, that there’s a good chance the Falcon Heavy will fail in its first launch attempt because some elements of its operation are impossible to fully test on the ground.

It will come in three sizes: a bus-sized vehicle, a shuttle and a small delivery vehicle sized to run on sidewalks. \nToyota said at the CES global technology conference in Las Vegas that it will work with companies including Amazon.com Inc, Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing Technology Co, Pizza Hut, Mazda Motor Corp and Uber Technologies Inc[UBER.UL] to build the vehicle and its hardware and software support and develop connected mobility products. \nAfter intense research and development in self-driving technology, automakers are beginning to unveil clearly defined autonomous vehicle strategies and looking to apply the technology to uses like ride services, shuttle services and package deliveries. \nToyota took longer than rivals to warm to the idea of autonomous vehicles, but has committed $1 billion through 2020 to develop advanced automated driving and artificial intelligence technology. It plans to begin testing cars that can drive themselves on highways around 2020. \n“This announcement marks a major step forward in our evolution towards sustainable mobility, demonstrating our continued expansion beyond traditional cars and trucks to the creation of new values including services for customers,” said Toyota President Akio Toyoda in a statement. \nThe vehicle features an open control interface enabling Toyota’s partner companies to install their own automated driving system. Toyota’s so-called “guardian” technology will then act as a safety net, the company said. \nCarmakers, tech companies and other service providers have partnered on self-driving projects over past two years, due to the difficulty and high cost of developing such technology alone.

He said as a result of the tax bill a stock owner's share of profits went to 79 percent from 65 percent. \n\"That's more than a 20 percent increase in the earning power. And you've just given it to me, nothing has changed in the business,\" he said. \nIn similar fashion, Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Jan. 3 raised its 2018 earnings-per-share forecast for the S&P 500 to $153 from $139 or 10 percent, using similar thinking. \nBuffett also said the magnitude of the corporate tax rate cut is not reflected in the stock market yet. \n\"I think 21 percent was not baked in. That's a huge reduction,\" he added. \nBuffett's right-hand man, Charlie Munger, welcomed the tax reform as economic policy more than his partner. \n\"I actually like this tax reduction that Berkshire's gotten. I'm an unabashed appreciator,\" he told CNBC on Wednesday. \nOn the tax plan he said, \"I think there is a chance that it might work quite well … I think the people that are sure that it won't work probably shouldn't be quite so sure.\" \nOther top hedge fund managers are on board in predicting further gains for the stock market, partly due to the higher profit streams from the lower tax burden. \nHedge fund manager David Tepper of Appaloosa Management told CNBC on Thursday that the market still isn't expensive. \n\"Explain to me where this market is rich? It's not rich with the tax thing that just changed earnings projections. With earnings forecasts going up and interest rates where they are, how is this market expensive?

Christopher Futcher | Getty Images \nIf you're looking for an affordable private school education, look no further than Nebraska. \nThe Cornhusker State is home to the lowest average tuition for private elementary and high school, according to the Private School Review , a site that gathers data on private institutions across the country. \nIn Nebraska, the average cost of private school during the 2017 to 2018 year was $3,155. In comparison, the national average was more than three times higher: $10,302. \nOn the other side of the spectrum, you can find the most costly private schools in Connecticut. There, the average private school tuition clocks in at $24,171. \nAlso, parents now have a new tool in the arsenal for tackling the cost of a private K-12 education: Their 529 college savings plans. \nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act makes these accounts – in which families can save free of taxes and can tap them for educational expenses – available for private school and not just college costs. \nFurther, over 30 states offer a tax deduction for households that contribute to a 529 plan. \nSee below for the nine other states with the lowest private school tuition costs. \nMore from Personal Finance", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T21:56:05.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

In 2016, another panel tossed out two majority black congressional districts initially drawn in 2011, saying there was no justification for using race as the predominant factor in forming them. The redrawn map was the basis for a new round of lawsuits.\nThe latest lawsuit — filed by election advocacy groups and Democrats — said the replacement to the racial gerrymander also were unlawful partisan gerrymanders. Those who sued argued that Republican legislators went too far when they followed criteria designed to retain the party's 10-3 majority.\nAt the time of debate, according to the order, House redistricting chief Rep. David Lewis attempted to justify the criteria by saying during debate that \"I think electing Republicans is better than electing Democrats. So I drew this map to help foster what I think is better for the country.\"\n\"We find that the General Assembly drew and enacted the 2016 plan with intent to subordinate the interests of non-Republican voters and entrench Republican control of North Carolina's congressional delegation,\" U.S. Circuit Court Judge Jim Wynn wrote in the majority opinion. Wynn added that the evidence shows the \"plan achieved the General Assembly's discriminatory partisan objective.\"\nIn their ruling Tuesday, the judges ordered the General Assembly to approve another set of districts by Jan. 24. Candidate filing for the November congressional elections begin Feb. 12. A majority of the judges also agreed they would also hire a redistricting expert to draw replacement boundaries if the legislature won't.\nThrough a spokeswoman, one of the legislative defendants, Sen.

The letter, which will also run as a full-page ad in national newspapers Thursday, estimates that allowing the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, to expire would result in a $215 billion hit to the economy. \n\"The imminent termination of the DACA program is creating an impending crisis for workforces across the country,\" the letter states. \"Failure to act in time will lead to businesses losing valuable talent, cause disruptions in the workforce and will result in significant costs.\" \nCompanies are seeking action by Jan. 19 — the deadline for averting a government shutdown — even though DACA does not end until March 5. That would provide the Department of Homeland Security with critical breathing room to make any necessary administration changes, the companies argue. \n\"It will take time for the agency to implement any program outlined by Congress, underscoring the absolute urgency of the January 19th deadline,\" the letter states. \nCorporate America has been a vocal advocate for a permanent pathway to citizenship for the program's roughly 700,000 undocumented immigrants, also known as \"Dreamers.\" Silicon Valley giants including Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates founded a group called FWD.us to pressure lawmakers to act, bringing roughly 100 DACA recipients to Washington this week for congressional meetings and to rally for a fix. \nThe new push comes as immigration emerges as the flashpoint in negotiations between Congress and the White House to keep the government running beyond Jan. 19. Republican leadership has declared that the two issues will be addressed in separate legislation, but Democratic Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer has made a DACA deal a prerequisite for supporting a government spending measure. \n\"We should come up with a plan here that Democrats and Republicans can agree on in terms of DACA, add it to the large spending bill and get it done — and get it done quickly,\" Schumer said Tuesday. \nAdding to the confusion was a California court ruling late Tuesday that halted the White House's phaseout of the program. Since the administration began winding it down in October, an estimated 122 DACA recipients have lost their protected status each day, according to an analysis by the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank. Those immigrants will be able to apply for renewal while the California court reviews the merits of the underlying case. \n\"This ruling underscores why a permanent, legislative solution must be passed to remove the ambiguity and uncertainty around DACA,\" IBM said in a statement to CNBC on Wednesday. \"IBM urges Congress to act now to protect Dreamers across the country.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T23:38:06.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The branch's president, Neel Kashkari, has been a vocal critic of major institutions, saying they continue to represent a systemic threat 10 years after the financial crisis. In the current deregulatory environment, the proposals stand little chance of getting approved. Chris Goodney | Bloomberg | Getty Images Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis \nThe Minneapolis Federal Reserve proposed a set of sweeping new regulations Wednesday aimed at reducing the risk big banks pose to the economy. \nAt the core of the recommendations are higher capital requirements for the nation's largest financial institutions, as well as a reduction in burdens for smaller regional and community banks. The proposals also take aim at so-called shadow banks — nonbank lenders — which are targeted for sharp taxes on the bigger firms. \nIn total, the proposal offers a contrast with the current regulatory aims of the White House, which is seeking to reduce many of the banking rules imposed by the Dodd-Frank reforms, adopted in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Incoming Fed Chairman Jerome Powell also has indicated that a lighter touch is likely for regulations. \n\"With today's strong economy, now is the perfect time to act to strengthen our financial system,\" Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said in a statement. \"We must not wait, and we must not go backwards. If we wait until the next crisis to implement these reforms, it will be too late.\" \nHowever, the proposals are non-binding and likely face a high bar for approval. \n\"Kashkari's approach to bank capital is simplistic in the extreme. He doesn't seem to understand that we've already de-risked the banking system to a large degree,\" said Christopher Whalen, head of Whalen Global Advisors, an investment banking and consulting services firm for institutional investors. \"What he's proposing is unnecessary and I doubt it would ever get any support in Washington.\" \nKashkari has long railed against big banks, arguing that even the sweeping Dodd-Frank bill did not end the issue of too big to fail. \nUnder the proposal released Wednesday, banks with assets of more than $250 billion — the top 13 institutions — would be required to issue equity equaling 23.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, with a leverage ratio of 15 percent, or nearly double the current 8 percent requirement. Doing so would reduce the chances of a public bailout from 67 percent to 39 percent, according to the Fed branch's calculations. \nThe plan also would call on the Treasury secretary to declare that large banks \"are no longer systemically important,\" a vital provision that would determine whether those institutions would get a publicly funded rescue. Those banks that aren't certified, and thus open to bailouts, would be required to increase their capital ratios to as high as 38 percent. \n\"Kashkari has been banging on this drum for a while. His solution is looking for a problem,\" said Whalen, who added that he would like to publicly debate Kashkari on the proposal. Whalen pointed out that Kashkari already has run for governor of California, and may have future political ambitions. \"I don't think Mr. Kashkari's proposal has any chance of success. He's clearly playing to a progressive audience, which also doesn't understand any of these things.\" \nKashkari was not availble for reaction to Whalen's comments. \nDuring a presentation Tuesday, Kashkari acknowledged that he has been politically active but said he and his family have settled in Minnesota and he is enjoying his job. \nAlso under his proposal, shadow banks also would come under increased scrutiny, with those having assets greater than $50 billion subject to a 1.2 percent tax on borrowings. Those that the Treasury secretary refuses to certify as systemically important would face a 2.2 percent tax. \nFinally, the Minneapolis plan calls for a reduction in \"unnecessary regulatory burden\" on community banks. \n\"The plan would fundamentally change the nature of community bank supervision, effectively limiting supervision to those aspects of community banking that pose real risk,\" the Fed branch said. \nThe proposals follow a two-year review by the Minneapolis Fed that sought to address the \"continuing risk\" posed by too big to fail institutions. \n\"After witnessing the economic devastation from the 2008 financial crisis, I am committed to working with other policymakers to strengthen our financial system and reduce the danger of a future crisis,\" Kashkari said. \nWATCH: Kashkari explains his position on interest rates . show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T18:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T18:36:17.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Reuters reported in December that Didi planned to enter Mexico this year. \nIt has previously partnered with overseas ride-hailing companies to offer reciprocal services in other countries, but Didi is now looking to launch its own services overseas. \nDidi's Mexico entry represents the 4-year-old firm's first move to deploy drivers under its own brand outside of China. \nCheng Wei, founder and chief executive of Didi, said in Wednesday's statement that \"globalization is a top strategic priority for Didi.\" \nDidi first invested $100 million in 99 in January 2017, getting a stake and management rights in the Brazilian app. \nOne source with knowledge of the matter said the funds selling their stakes in 99 started looking for a buyer several months ago, in mid-2017. \nRiverwood, Monashees, Tiger Global, and SoftBank did not reply to requests for comment. \nDidi has made no secret of its desire to expand beyond China, particularly in light of the growing number of Chinese customers who travel overseas. \nThe firm sealed its dominance in the Chinese market after buying out Uber's local China business in 2016, ending an expensive subsidy war that cost the U.S. firm roughly $2 billion. \nIn December, Didi raised $4 billion from investors, in part to fund global expansion, following on from a $5.5 billion fundraising in April.

McDonnell Douglas MD-82 plane sits parked at a gate while a United Continental Holdings plane taxis down the runway at LaGuardia Airport in the Queens borough of New York. \nTax reform should boost business travel this year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and that in turn will boost shares of the country's biggest airlines, including American Airlines, United Continental and Delta, the investment bank said. \n\"We view tax reform as a significant positive for corporate spending (banks, media companies and even airlines have given $1,000 one-time bonuses to employees), and we believe this can drive a pickup in corporate travel pricing,\" wrote analyst Andrew Didora.­­ \"Since 2014, we estimate corporate pricing is down 14 percent. ... This coupled with strong international fundamentals should create a solid backdrop for the legacy airlines that are more levered to corporate travel than domestic, leisure-oriented airlines.\" \nThe analyst changed his tune on American Airlines , upgrading the company to buy from underperform, and reiterated his buy ratings on Delta and United . American and United traded higher Tuesday following the bullish call. Delta initially rose but then headed into negative territory. \nGiven that those airlines generate roughly two-thirds of their revenue from business travel, any recovery in corporate pricing as a result of the Republican tax plan should disproportionately benefit those companies, Didora said. \nAll three underperformed the S&P 500 in 2017, though United disappointed the most, plagued with public relations problems throughout the year. Some extra cash as a result of revived corporate travel could be the key for improving equity prices. \n\"In a scenario in which corporate prices returned to the same levels as four years ago, corporate revenues could grow 15 percent, driving a strong fundamental backdrop for the industry and an even better outlook,\" added Didora. \nThe new tax law includes a corporate tax rate of 21 percent, down from 35 percent in an effort to make the U.S. more competitive globally. The law is expected to free up cash in a slew of industries, including industrials and financials. \nThough more bullish on some names, the analyst did issue some downgrades as well. Cutting his rating on Southwest and Alaska to neutral from buy and downgrading JetBlue to underperform from buy, Didora noted that domestic travel could suffer at the hands of international and business trips. \n\"We believe Southwest is the highest quality airline in the group with a very conservative balance sheet and low earnings volatility,\" he said. \"However, we expect business travel and international markets to outperform Southwest's largely domestic-oriented system in 2018.\" \nThe same assessment applied to Alaska, which Didora called \"an exceptionally well-run airline\" despite its focus on domestic travel. \nShares of Alaska and Southwest fell Tuesday, down 0.5 percent and 1 percent respectively. JetBlue was up slightly. \n— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T17:39:09.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Bond yields are likely to rise only slowly, but that will result in basically flat returns for fixed income, Gross told CNBC. 1 Hour Ago | 03:45 \nThe great bond bull market that began in 1981 is ending with a whimper, fixed income guru Bill Gross said Wednesday. \nEvery new year on Wall Street brings fresh predictions that bond yields will rise and destroy what has been a reliable source of income for investors. And each year, those predictions are wrong. \nHowever, Gross, who runs the Janus Henderson Global Unconstrained Bond Fund , said 2018 is the year the luck finally runs out. But rather than a coming to close with a massive thud, Gross sees fixed income merely running out of gas due to a number of factors. \nHe used a coffee analogy to make his point. \n\"It's not a strong Colombian bear market, it's a decaffeinated bear market, where yields on the 10-year probably rise 10 to 20 to 30 basis points for the year,\" Gross said during an interview on CNBC's \" Power Lunch .\" \"Nevertheless, it means yields are probably moving higher instead of lower.\" Lucy Nicholson | Reuters Bill Gross \nThe latest round of bond bear market calls has become increasingly powerful since the benchmark 10-year note hit what many considered a generational low yield of 1.43 percent on July 11. Most recently, the yield has risen to 2.56 percent, a level not seen since March 2017. \nRising yields mean lower prices, which in turn cut into returns for bond investors looking for capital appreciation. Bond funds hold about $4.5 trillion in investor cash, with the bulk in mutual funds, according to the Investment Company Institute. \nGross said the days of mid-single digit returns for bond investors are likely over. \n\"I think bonds produce a return of zero to 1 percent,\" he said. \"Is that a bear market? No. But it's a market where investors don't get much of a return.\" \nGross has been bearish on both stocks and bonds for at least the past six months, and his fund has suffered as a result. Earlier in the day, he told Bloomberg News that the unconstrained fund is short the bond market. \nThe $2.2 billion fund has returned just 2.2 percent over the past year, placing it in the bottom quarter of Morningstar rankings. \nGross cited three reasons for his bearish bond call: Rising nominal U.S. GDP that will stoke inflation, reduced purchases from global central banks, and higher budget deficits in the U.S. \n\"The flush of money is being met by a flush of supply, and that produces higher rates,\" he said, noting that central banks have injected $14 trillion of liquidity into the market over the past five years. \n\"If we posit that in September or October much of this doesn't go away but it stops increasing, then the pressure for slightly higher yields is probably with us,\" he said. \nThe European Central Bank has indicated that its quantitative easing program probably will end this year, and the U.S. Federal Reserve already has begun slowly shrinking the size of its nearly $4.5 trillion balance sheet. \nGross said he expects the Fed to move slowly on rate hikes, with just two likely for 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T22:19:40.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The Republican tax plan reduced the deductions that homeowners can take for property taxes and mortgage interest. In higher-priced housing markets and in states with high property-tax rates, that makes homebuying more expensive than it was just a few weeks ago.\n\nBuyers are also facing higher prices due to a severe lack of supply. More homes should begin to come on the market this month and next, with sellers hoping to get the jump on the spring market, especially those who are selling in order to buy another home.

The dollar could end up losing out to the euro and yen if the U.S. proceeds with protectionist activity, and could ultimately be less attractive as a reserve currency, he said. Earlier, the dollar moved lower on a report that Chinese officials were considering buying fewer or stopping purchases of Treasury securities due to their unattractiveness but also trade issues. SHARES \nProtectionism may be a problem for the U.S. dollar. \nIf the U.S. pulls out of NAFTA, the Mexican peso could lose as much as another 10 percent, but the U.S. dollar could also get slammed against major world currencies, according to Jens Nordvig, CEO of Exante Data. Getty Images \nThe currency strategist said U.S. protectionism is one of the biggest threats to the dollar and one of the biggest sources of dollar volatility. \nReuters Wednesday quoted unnamed Canadian government officials saying they are increasingly convinced that President Donald Trump will withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement. The next round of talks is scheduled for Jan. 23 in Canada. \nThe peso lost 0.9 percent, and the Canadian dollar fell one percent on the report. \nNordvig said the size of the Canadian dollar's decline is unusual, and the loonie has not previously reacted as intensely during prior NAFTA scares. If NAFTA fails, he said the Canadian dollar would decline further but not as much as the five to 10 percent decline he expects to see in the peso. \n\"Mexico is more vulnerable. Over time, we think the Mexican move is going to play out more forcefully. What the dollar does on a global scale is more tricky,\" said Nordvig. \nIf the 24 year old treaty is tossed, years of integration between Mexico, Canada and the U.S. will be at risk. Supporters of NAFTA claim prices will rise if the U.S. kills the trade deal, and the U.S. will find itself at the start of what could turn into trade wars. But critics of NAFTA say it has allowed U.S. manufacturing and workers to be undermined by low cost goods coming in from Mexico, which has a $60 billion trade deficit with the U.S. \n\"The dollar will suffer against the euro but the market is not really having a clear view on this. The euro is actually down on these headlines. The market is actually so confused about what it means for the global dollar,\" said Nordvig. \nEarlier Wednesday, the dollar sank on another trade related story. Bloomberg reported that unnamed Chinese officials were considering stopping purchases of U.S. Treasurys because of their unattractiveness but also trade issues. \nThe Trump administration is expected to make recommendations on steel and aluminum this month that could impact China. \nBut Nordvig said it would take a much bigger trade event than product tarriffs to really damage the dollar, and if the U.S. does engage in full scale protectionism, the dollar could ultimatley be seen as less attractive as a reserve currency. \nCanada, the U.S. and Mexico have held five rounds of talks to renegotiate NAFTA but U.S. demands on how trade issues are resolved and the treaty's permanence have been among the thorny issues for Canada and Mexico. \nEarlier Wednesday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer called a case filed by Canada with the World Trade Organization against the U.S. for U.S. disciplinary practices and procedures \"a broad and ill-advised attack\" on the U.S. trade remedies system. \n\"Even if Canada succeeded on these groundless claims, other countries would primarily benefit, not Canada. For example, if the U.S. removed the orders listed in Canada's complaint, the flood of imports from China and other countries would negatively impact billions of dollars in Canadian exports to the United States, including nearly $9 billion in exports of steel and aluminum products and more than $2.5 billion in exports of wood and paper products,\" the trade representative said in a statement.

Free Democratic Party (FDP) member Nicola Beer gives a statement at the party headquarters in Berlin, Germany, November 20, 2017. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke \nShe said networks such as Twitter need to take some responsibility for posts on their platforms but “without being given the role of judge”. \nAfter the Titanic account was blocked a Twitter spokesman said the company did not comment on individual accounts for reasons of privacy and security. \nSahra Wagenknecht, parliamentary leader of the radical Left, told the Funke group of newspapers that her party supported initiatives to abandon the law. \n“The law is a slap in the face for all democratic principles because, in a constitutional state, courts rather than companies make decisions about what is unlawful and what is not,” she said. \nThe AfD has already announced that it will consider filing a complaint against the law. \nOn Thursday Germany’s top-selling Bild newspaper also called for the law to be scrapped, saying it was stifling free speech and making martyrs out of anti-immigrant politicians whose posts are deleted. \n($1 = 0.8314 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-07T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-07T19:15:50.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

(SpaceX), speaks during the 67th International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Guadalajara, Mexico, on Tuesday, Sept. 27, 2016. comments \nA military satellite launched by Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies hasn’t been spotted in orbit by the U.S. Strategic Command, creating a mystery about the fate of the classified payload and doubts about whether the mission was a success. \nThe mission — referred to by the code name Zuma — took off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida Sunday on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket . But the Strategic Command, which monitors more than 23,000 man-made objects in space, said it is not tracking any new satellites since the launch. \n“We have nothing to add to the satellite catalog at this time,” Navy Captain Brook DeWalt, a spokesman for the command, said in an email when asked if the new satellite was in orbit. \nA U.S. official and two congressional aides, all familiar with the launch, said on condition of anonymity that the second-stage of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 booster rocket failed. The satellite was lost, one of the congressional aides said, and the other said both the satellite and the second-stage satellite fell into the ocean after the failure. \n“We do not comment on missions of this nature; but as of right now reviews of the data indicate Falcon 9 performed nominally,” James Gleeson, a spokesman for SpaceX, said in an email. \nRead: Look at These Incredible Photos of the SpaceX Falcon Heavy Rocket \nTim Paynter, a spokesman for Northrop noc , which was commissioned by the Defense Department to choose the launch contractor, said “we cannot comment on classified missions,” and Army Lieutenant Colonel Jamie Davis, the Pentagon’s spokesman for space policy, referred questions to SpaceX. \nThe launch is SpaceX’s first in what was expected to be a busy year. The company has said it plans to launch about 30 missions in 2018 after completing a record 18 last year. The launch had been pushed back several times since late 2017, with the past week’s extreme weather on the East Coast contributing to the most recent delay. \nThe Zuma mission was a clear success on at least one count: SpaceX successfully landed the rocket’s first stage for reuse in a future launch, a key step in its goal to drive down the cost of access to space. \nSpaceX’s 23-minute webcast of the Zuma launch Sunday evening included the Falcon 9 launch, confirmation that the fairings deployed, and the rocket’s first-stage recovery on land in Florida. Cheers from employees could be heard from Mission Control at the company’s headquarters in Hawthorne, California. \nThe webcast then concluded. During missions for commercial satellite customers, SpaceX typically returns to the webcast to confirm that the payload has separated from the second stage, but Zuma was a classified mission so the lack of further messages wasn’t surprising. \nSpaceX, the closely held company founded and led by chief executive officer Elon Musk — who also heads the electric auto manufacturer Tesla tsla — is slated to demonstrate the maiden flight of Falcon Heavy, a larger and more powerful rocket, later this month. SpaceX, along with Boeing ba , also has a contract with NASA to fly astronauts to the International Space Station as part of the “Commercial Crew” program, with the first crucial test flight slated for the second quarter. \nSpaceX competes for military launches with United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin lmt , which was the sole provider for the Pentagon until Musk launched a campaign in Congress and the courts challenging what he called an unfair monopoly. After a rigorous Air Force review, SpaceX was certified in 2015 to compete for military launches.

Each year, on average, 5 percent to 20 percent of the U.S. population contracts the flu, tens of thousands are hospitalized, and between 3,000 and 49,000 Americans die from flu-related illness, according to the CDC. The flu strikes indiscriminately, but young children, the elderly and the chronically ill are most vulnerable. \nCaring for the sick is costly. The CDC estimates that the flu costs the United States $10.4 billion a year in direct medical expenses and another $16.3 billion in lost earnings annually. A chunk of those billions is spent formulating, growing and distributing millions of doses of the annual flu vaccine, which from year to year reduces the risk of illness by 40 percent to 60 percent at best. The flu vaccine is the only one that has to be reformulated and administered every year. Most of the vaccine is grown in eggs, an arduous process that takes around six months. The race to make a universal vaccine \nThe definition of a universal flu vaccine is somewhat flexible. Ideally, a single injection would protect against all known and emerging influenza A strains and last a lifetime, said Peter Palese, a microbiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. More modest proposals envision a one-shot vaccine that would protect against getting the flu for anywhere from three to 20 years. Erica Spackman | USDA | Reuters The Avian influenza virus is harvested from a chicken egg as part of a diagnostic process in this undated U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) handout image. U.S. farm and health officials are racing to assess the threat that a type of bird flu never before seen in the country poses to humans and poultry, employing emergency plans drawn up in the wake of a devastating outbreak in birds last year. \nPalese's laboratory is one of three different research groups at Mount Sinai exploring a universal flu vaccine and one of numerous efforts under way mostly in academia, biotech firms and NIH. A handful of major pharmaceutical companies are supporting universal flu vaccine research, including GlaxoSmithKline ; Janssen Vaccines, a division of Johnson & Johnson ; and Sanofi . \nPalese's team has developed a universal flu vaccine that is now in the first phase of testing in humans, with support from GSK and the Gates Foundation. \"What changes in the influenza virus from year to year is the hemagglutinin (HA),\" Palese explained, \"which is the major protein against which we make an immune response.\" \nThe HA comprises a head and a stalk. \"When our immune system sees a flu virus, it makes antibodies against the head,\" he said. Palese's vaccine aims to stimulate antibodies that bind to the more \"conserved\" areas on the stalk and which remain the same every year and are common to most seasonal flu viruses. \"We want to redirect the body's immune response to the stalk.\" \nA different approach to the universal vaccine is under way at FluGen, a biotech firm in Madison, Wisconsin. Backed by both government and VC funding, the company is working with technology first discovered at the University of Wisconsin-Madison by Dr. Yoshihiro Kawaoka and Dr. Gabriele Neumann and exclusively licensed to FluGen. \"Our vaccine, called RedeeFlu, is based on a premise that says what happens if you take a [naturally occurring] 'wild type' of flu virus and modify it to infect the human body but don't allow it to replicate and cause illness,\" said Boyd Clarke, executive chairman of FluGen. (Coincidentally, his maternal grandfather died in the 1918 pandemic.) \nLast October, FluGen announced that it was awarded $14.4 million by the Department of Defense to conduct human clinical challenge trials with RedeeFlu. In those studies, half of the participants will be vaccinated and half will receive a placebo, but all will subsequently be infected with an influenza virus. \"We want to see if the vaccine prevents illness and replication of the virus,\" Clarke said. \"Based on pre-clinical trials, we have reason to be optimistic.\" \nOn another front, this year the Human Vaccines Project , a New York-based nonprofit consortium of academic, government and industry medical researchers, is launching the Universal Influenza Vaccine Initiative. \"The goal is to understand immunity to the flu and then convert that into a universal flu vaccine,\" said Dr. James Crowe, a pediatric infectious diseases physician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, and the director of UIVI. Similar to Palese's approach, UIVI is targeting the more stable stalk region of the HA protein. \nAlthough Crowe is dedicated to the eventual discovery of a universal vaccine, he also wants to focus on improving current vaccines. \"The excitement in the field is making better vaccines for strains that are killing people right now,\" he said. \"Even modest improvements would save thousands of lives.\" \n— By Bob Woods, special to CNBC.com Bob Woods Special to CNBC.com Related Securities ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T18:15:47.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Tesla unveiled the product in October 2016 as it sought to acquire solar installer SolarCity. \nAt that time, Tesla said the product could be rolled out as soon as the summer of 2017. In November, Tesla founder Elon Musk said the product was going through a six-month testing process, saying \"it just takes a little while to get this behemoth rolling.\" \nMore than a dozen Tesla employees, including Musk and Chief Technical Officer JB Straubel, had the solar roofs installed on their homes last year as part of an initial pilot program. \nTesla started taking orders for the solar roof tiles in May by asking homeowners to put down a $1,000 deposit via its web site. Tesla would not disclose how many reservations it had received for the solar roof. The product will be installed on some customer rooftops in the coming months. \nThe company has said its solar roofs would cost between 10 and 15 percent less than an ordinary new roof plus traditional solar panels. \nTesla is collaborating with its longstanding battery partner, Japan's Panasonic, to manufacture solar products at the Buffalo factory. There are about 500 employees working at the site currently, Tesla said. \nThe companies began production of traditional solar panels at the site last year, but they have not yet been installed on rooftops. The company said it will achieve more than 1 gigawatt of cell and module production in Buffalo, and possibly as much as double that, but gave no timeline for meeting the target. \nTesla said its primary focus is increasing production of its Model 3 sedan. The company said last week it would likely build about 2,500 Model 3s a week by the end of the first quarter, half the number it had earlier promised.

Photo by Kirsten Korosec By Kirsten Korosec 10:40 PM EST \nByton, a new China-based company founded by automotive veterans of BMW (bmwyy) and Infiniti, unveiled Sunday an all-electric SUV loaded with technology that aims to supersize the experience and functionality of a smartphone. \nIf the founders pull this off, drivers and passengers will no longer reach for their smartphone or other smart devices while on the road. Instead, the vehicle will take care of all of their needs with a simply hand gesture or voice command. \nThe all-electric SUV was unveiled on the first media day at CES 2018, the annual tech trade show in Las Vegas. \nThe base version of the car, which starts at about $45,000, will have a 71-kilowatt-hour battery pack that can travel 250 miles on a single charge. Byton says this base model will be able to charge its battery 80% in 30 minutes. A more expensive version, figures the company didn’t provide, will be four-wheel drive and be able to travel 325 miles on a single charge. \nInitially, the vehicles will be sold in China. But by first half of 2020, the SUV will be available in North America. Sales in Europe will follow later that year. \nThe new company, formerly Future Mobility Corporation, was founded by Carsten Breitfeld, the former head of the BMW i8 program, and Daniel Kirchert, the former managing director of Infiniti China and a longtime BMW executive. Not a lot was known about the company until recently. Last month, Byton showed some teaser images and basic information at a North American media introduction event in Santa Clara, California. \nBreitfeld and Kirchert are calling the medium-ish SUV crossover an SIV, or “smart intuitive vehicle.” And there’s good reason. The vehicle, which compared to virtually every other CES concept reveal I’ve been to in recent years, looks decidedly normal. Kirchert told Fortune before the unveiling that what they’re showing is 80% complete. \nAnd it’s loaded with technology, from a sweeping display that takes up the entire dashboard and another touchscreen on the steering wheel, to “smart” connected features that will let future customers use hand gestures and voice commands via Amazon’s Alexa assistant to control aspects of the car. The vehicle will even monitor the driver’s heart rate, weight, oxygen saturation, or blood pressure. \n“We think the “SIV” will be a new category (in automotive), Kirchert told Fortune . “The car is really becoming more of a smart device, allowing the driver and passengers to have their own digital experience, and a seamless kind of experience that doesn’t require you to use your smartphone or other smart devices.” \n“We also think this is very important to get the car and the design of the car ready for the future of autonomous and shared mobility,” Kirchert added. \nThe SUV will come with Level 3 autonomous capabilities. This designation, determined by SAE International, is what’s described as conditional automation. This means that the car can handle most aspects of driving in the right conditions with the expectation that the human driver will respond when asked to intervene. \nLevel 4, which Byton is promising in the future, means the car takes over all of the driving in certain conditions. \nOne of the more interesting concepts is what the company calls Byton Life, a “smart and open digital cloud platform that seamlessly connects all your applications, data and devices.” Byton Life is what the company describes as the technical backbone. It will allow the driver and passengers to integrate third-party services like music and video streaming, and other ecosystems, like syncing to their fitness trackers or wearables. \nIt’s also meant to get smarter and more intuitive about the driver’s needs and wants over time. Information collected is connected to the user’s personal Byton ID and stored in the company’s cloud. When the driver enters the car, facial recognition technology identifies the person and their personal profile. Their preferences and content is downloaded from the cloud. \nByton Life is an open platform, and the company is offering a software development kit, or SDK, for developers to build services for Byton. Courtesy of Byton \nByton is rooted in China, but it has global sales aspirations. Byton’s global headquarters, research and development, local sales and factory are located in China. Its engineering work—basically anything to do with autonomous driving, sensors, and software development—occurs at its North American headquarters in Santa Clara, California. The vehicle platform was designed in Germany. \nByton is working with a number of suppliers, including Bosch for the electric power trains, Faurecia for the interior of the car as well as the seats, and Beijing, China-based BOE for the big screen. Byton is working with two battery supplies as well as an autonomous vehicle technology company, which have yet to be disclosed. \nThe company has raised $320 million from outside investors. Additional sources of funding from lenders will be used to help build the factory in Nanjing. Byton plans to raise additional capital from investors in a Series B round this year, Kirchert told Fortune . \nConstruction on the factory began in September 2017 and the building is expected to be completed by the third quarter of this year. Trial production will begin in early 2019. Kirchert says mass production should be ready by the end of 2019.

That would more than cover an expected $3 billion fourth-quarter charge.\nBut Citigroup might get a profit pickup in 2019 of only $1.7 billion, or 11 percent, Kleinhanzl said. That would be far less than the $19.7 billion he expects in total fourth-quarter charges.\nBank of America earns about 90 percent of its income in the United States, according to estimates by analyst Richard Ramsden of Goldman Sachs. Citigroup, meanwhile, has been getting only about 50 percent of its earnings at home, so will not benefit as much from lower U.S. tax rates.\nAnalysts plan to push executives in conference calls for clues about whether investors will benefit as much as they hope.\nBanks could provide a boon by putting more money toward stock buybacks and dividends.

They also want the company to study the effects of heavy usage on mental health. \n“There is a growing body of evidence that, for at least some of the most frequent young users, this may be having unintentional negative consequences,” according to the letter from the investors, who combined own about $2 billion in Apple shares. The “growing societal unease” is “at some point is likely to impact even Apple.” \n“Addressing this issue now will enhance long-term value for all shareholders,” the letter said. \nAn Apple spokesman declined to comment on the letter, which was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal . Parental Controls \nIt’s problem most companies would kill to have: Young people liking a product too much. But as smartphones become ubiquitous, government leaders and Silicon Valley alike have wrestled for ways to limit their inherent intrusiveness. \nFrance, for instance, has moved to ban the use of smartphones in its primary and middle schools. Meanwhile, Android co-founder Andy Rubin is seeking to apply artificial intelligence to phones so that they perform relatively routine tasks without needing to be physically handled. \nApple already offers some parental controls, such as the Ask to Buy feature, which requires parental approval to buy goods and services. Restrictions can also be placed on access to some apps, content and data usage. \nThe activist pressure is the latest in a series of challenges for the tech giant. Last week, Cupertino, California-based Apple said that all of its Mac computers and iOS devices, which include both the iPhones and iPads, faced security vulnerabilities due to flawed chips made by Intel (intc) . At the tail end of 2017, the company apologized to customers for software changes that resulted in older versions of its iPhones running slower than newly introduced editions.

They should think twice before becoming incorporated. \nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act offers a 20 percent deduction for qualified business income from so-called pass-through entities, which include S corporations and limited liability companies. \nUnder the \"old\" tax code, income from these small businesses would \"pass-through\" to the owner on her own taxes and were subject to individual income tax rates as high as 39.6 percent. \nNow, entrepreneurs are subject to a tax break on the income their businesses generate, but many of them face a key decision: Is it now time to incorporate — and if so, what entity should you choose? \n\"Everyone wants to form an LLC,\" said Sepi Ghiasvand, who is of counsel at Hopkins Carley in Palo Alto, California. \"This is a time when an LLC can save you on taxes, but with a caveat.\" \nHere are the things to consider before incorporating your business . Not a free-for-all \nThe new tax law's 20 percent deduction on qualified business income is subject to limitations that keep it from being a free-for-all for every entrepreneur. \nIn general, to qualify for the full deduction, your taxable income must be below $157,500 if you're single or $315,000 if you're married and file jointly. \nFilers who are below those thresholds may take the deduction no matter what business they're in, said Jeffrey Levine, a certified public accountant and director of financial planning at BluePrint Wealth Alliance in Garden City, New York. \"We've seen plaintiffs' counsel pierce the corporate veil because business owners treat the corporation as a piggy bank and don't maintain bylaws\" -Rick Keller, chairman of First Foundation \nHowever, once taxable income exceeds those thresholds, the law places limits on who can take the break. For instance, entrepreneurs with service businesses — including doctors, lawyers and financial advisors — may not be able to take advantage of the deduction if their income is too high. \nFinally, partners in a business may also find themselves in a situation in which one owner gets the 20 percent deduction and the other doesn't. That's because a partner with a high-income spouse may wind up exceeding the taxable income threshold. \n\"What's fascinating is that you can have two people doing the same work for the same pay, but only one can take the deduction on their return because of other factors,\" said Levine. How it works \nThe 20 percent deduction is considered a \"between the lines\" deduction in that it doesn't lower your adjusted gross income and you don't have to itemize on your taxes in order to take it. \nGenerally, if you qualify for the deduction, the 20 percent break will apply to the lesser of your qualified business income or your taxable income minus capital gains. See below for an example from Levine of BluePrint Wealth Alliance. \nKey Facts: Joint filer with a Schedule C business has a standard deduction of $24,000Business gross income of $130,000Business expenses of $30,000Net profit from business $100,000 (qualified business income)Spouse works and makes $70,000Above-the-line deductions of $7,500 for deductible portion of self-employment tax and $20,000 for SEP IRA contribution Analysis: Taxable income before application of pass-through deduction = $118,500In this case, the taxable income of $118,500 is greater than the qualified business income of $100,000. As a result, the 20 percent pass through deduction will apply to the qualified business income, resulting in a $20,000 deduction.This couple is in the 22 percent tax bracket, so they save about $4,400 in federal taxes. LLC formation \nOne big advantage in establishing an LLC is the fact that it protects owners from having their personal assets seized by the business's creditors. \nSetting up your LLC may cost a couple hundred to a couple thousand dollars, and you'll be required to file your documents with the state in which your business is based. \nYou will have to tell the IRS how it should tax your business, using Form 8832 : Is your business a corporation, a partnership or should it be on your personal tax return? \nWhat you choose matters, and here's why. Hero Images | Getty Images Social Security \nEntrepreneurs must pay self-employment taxes, which include payments toward Social Security, of 15.3 percent. However, profits that pass through from an S-corp. are subject only to income taxes. \nIn that case, an owner of an S-corp. would pay the self-employment tax from his salary, instead. Compliance requirements \nIn order to maintain their liability protection and preferred tax status, owners of S-corps. (and C-corps.) need to have an operating agreement in place, maintain books and records, and track their minutes. \n\"We've seen plaintiffs' counsel pierce the corporate veil because business owners treat the corporation as a piggy bank and don't maintain bylaws,\" said Rick Keller, chairman of First Foundation in Irvine, California. Consistent profits \nOnce your business consistently exceeds $70,000 in annual profits after expenses from 1099 income (as opposed to W-2 wages), it might be time to consider setting up an S-corp., according to Howard Samuels, a CPA and managing partner at Samuels & Associates in Florham Park, New Jersey. \nThat's because S-corps. are subject to bookkeeping requirements: Owners need to file returns for themselves and the business. They also need payroll services to ensure that taxes are correctly deducted. \nOwners should weigh how much they will save on taxes with an S-corp. versus how much they will pay to set it up and maintain it. \nWatch: Here's what Trump will discuss in his first major speech since tax overhaul passed show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T22:26:54.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

However, he's forced to walk away from making a deal when he learns one of Rayjus' co-owners, Ray Odom, has a side job as a controversial local radio personality.\nMuch to Lemonis' astonishment, Odom says the character he portrays on the radio is \"a sexist, egotistical, racist pig,\" but clarifies he's still \"a dad in real life\" who cares about his family and employees.\nJustin Romines and Odom started Rayjus as equal partners in 2010 with the goal to bring professional-looking sports shirts to amateur fishermen.

However, because fishing is a seasonal sport, they faced unpredictable revenue.\nStill, Lemonis found the Under Armour-like dry fit shirts Rayjus produced \"really cool\" and thought they could potentially sell well at his outdoor goods stores. These custom shirts make up about 80 percent of the business and earn the business about $1 million in revenue, according to the co-owners.\nBut while the product and money-making potential were there, Lemonis quickly uncovered key issues with how the business was being run.\nHere are two lessons you can learn from Lemonis' experience.\nValue your team members or office morale will suffer When Lemonis visited the Rayjus facility, he found that it was \"quite literally a sweatshop,\" with the women sewing and creating the garments in an unairconditioned factory. Meanwhile, the rest of the men worked in air-conditioned cubicles in an adjacent part of the building. The employees also told Lemonis that there were days when the factory would be working at full speed while the rest of the men went out fishing.\n\"Maybe one of the reasons that the business is struggling is because these guys are only putting in four days of effort,\" Lemonis said.\nLemonis noted that aside from the rough physical conditions Rayjus employees faced, the owners were running the business like a \"house of cards.\" As a result of poor business margins, the company had an inadequate cash flow, causing them to fall behind not only on their taxes, but also with paying their employees on time.\nTo help compensate, Odom explained to Lemonis that he works two days a week as a local radio disc jockey.\nMake sure you know who you're working with Odom noted that despite being a \"dad in real life\" and a guy who cares about his family, his character on the radio was \"a sexist, egotistical, racist pig.\"\n\"I knew Ray had a side job and I thought it may be a distraction, but I didn't realize that the focus of it was to demonize minorities and degrade women,\" Lemonis said.\nOnce Lemonis learned Odom made a living by telling people he's a sexist and a racist, he said he felt \"uncomfortable really fast.\"\n\"I am a big believer that you are who you do business with,\" Lemonis told Romines and Odom. \"And so the fact that you think I would do business with you because you do that, whether it's your personality or not, I just can't.\"\nAfter walking through the facilities, meeting the Rayjus employees and learning more about the business' day-to-day operations, Lemonis couldn't bring himself to continue helping Rayjus.\nshow chapters Marcus Lemonis gives Tumbleweed Tiny House CEO leadership advice to help pull this company out of million-dollar debt      1:35 PM ET Wed, 29 Nov 2017 | 01:10 \"I can get over business problems — fix the process, make it safe, put the air condition in, figure out how to pay the taxes, create a better work environment, sell more, diversify the product — I can fix those,\" Lemonis said. \"I can't fix you for being a racist and a sexist, but here's the good news: I won't have to fix it because I'm not going to be here.\" \n\nLike this story?

Bannon's comments about the Trump family to author Michael Wolff sparked backlash from both President Donald Trump and his top financial backer, Rebekah Mercer. Bannon was Trump's White House chief strategist and his campaign chief executive. CNBC.com SHARES \nSteve Bannon, the former chief strategist to President Donald Trump , is stepping down from Breitbart News, the news outlet confirmed Tuesday. \nBannon, who was Breitbart's executive chairman, exits after comments he made about the president's family brought a stinging rebuke from the White House and partly led to his top financial backers abandoning him . On Sunday, Bannon said he \"regrets\" the fiery comments about the president's two eldest children , Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump. He again pledged his support for President Trump's policies. \nBreitbart, a generally pro-Trump site, said it will work with Bannon on a \"smooth and orderly transition.\" \n\"I'm proud of what the Breitbart team has accomplished in so short a period of time in building out a world-class news platform,\" Bannon said in a statement. Getty Images Steve Bannon speaks before introducing Republican Senatorial candidate Roy Moore during a campaign event at Oak Hollow Farm on December 5, 2017 in Fairhope, Alabama. \nThe wealthy GOP donor Rebekah Mercer, who last week said she would no longer fund Bannon's initiatives, forced his exit, according to The New York Times, which first reported on Bannon's departure. She is a member of Breitbart's board and last week pledged support for Trump \"and the platform upon which he was elected.\" \nBannon helped to drive Trump's nationalist messaging in the final months of the 2016 election, contributing to the then-candidate's harsh criticisms of free trade and China. He then was one of Trump's top White House advisors before he left in August. \nWhen he returned to Breitbart from the White House, Bannon pledged to use the outlet as a tool against so-called establishment Republican figures and enemies of Trump's agenda. He planned to champion numerous upstart GOP candidates. He backed Republican ex-Judge Roy Moore in Alabama's Senate special election primary over then-Sen. Luther Strange, only to see Moore lose to Democrat Doug Jones in the general election in December. \nExcerpts of a tell-all book, \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,\" were released last week and featured numerous quotes from Bannon. Among other statements, he called a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower that included Donald Trump Jr., former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a Russian lawyer \"treasonous\" and said special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation would \"crack Don Junior like an egg.\" He also called Ivanka Trump \"dumb as a brick.\" \nThose statements prompted the president to declare that Bannon had \"lost his mind.\" \nIn apologizing Sunday, Bannon said media reports misinterpreted his comment about the younger Trump. He instead meant it about Manafort, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T23:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T23:33:51.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The two Republicans who voted against Perry's proposal, Chairman Kevin McIntyre and Robert Powelson, \"are wrong in their decision and it needs to be overturned,\" he said. \nFERC is an independent government agency that regulates interstate transport of oil and natural gas and electric power transmission. It has a long-standing reputation as a highly technocratic, non-partisan organization. \nPerry asked FERC in September to create a rule that would compensate plants that keep 90 days of supply on site — primarily coal and nuclear facilities — arguing this so-called baseload energy is necessary to keep the U.S. grid resilient. show chapters 6:50 PM ET Mon, 8 Jan 2018 | 01:05 \n\"There is no ask here for a subsidy for coal,\" Murray said. \"It's to pay the coal-fired generators and the nuclear electricity generators for having the capacity in the grid to keep the lights on.\" \nMurray noted that during the recent \"bomb cyclone\" and cold snap that followed, higher power demand pushed natural gas prices to $175 per million British thermal unit — 60 times their typical level. \nHowever, that statistic is misleading. Prices only spiked to that level in one area of New York, according to Jacob Meisel, chief weather analyst at Bespoke Weather Services. \nPower prices did rise in many parts of the United States, he said, particularly in New England, where there is limited natural gas pipeline capacity. During extreme cold, home heating competes with power plants for natural gas supplies. \nBut in New England, oil-fired plants played a much greater role than coal plants in making up for increased power demand during the cold snap. Oil provided more then 30 percent of power during the period, while coal units supplied 4-6 percent. \nThere were no grid reliability issues during the recent cold spell in PJM Interconnection, which operates the the grid and power markets in 13 Eastern states and Washington DC, according to a spokesperson. \n\"Unit outages across fuel types were manageable and there were sufficient reserves and no emergency procedures needed,\" Susan Buehler, chief communications officer at PJM, told CNBC. \nOn Tuesday, The New York Times published a story on Murray's influence over Trump's energy policy . The report resurfaced accusations by environmental groups that Murray hand-delivered the coal and nuclear subsidy proposal to Perry. \nMurray denies that charge. @SenWhitehouse: MUST READ: This is a very important look into the influence Murray Energy Corporation has over the Trump Administration. Murray Energy made a wish list, and @realDonaldTrump is granting its wishes. \nThe groups pointed to wording in a memo Murray gave to Perry during a meeting in March, first revealed last month in photographs seen by In These Times. The investigative reporting website noted the wording closely resembles text from Perry's proposal to FERC : \nImmediate action needs to be taken to require organized power markets to value fuel security, fuel diversity, and ancillary services that only base load generating assets, especially coal plants, can provide — Murray Energy memo \nImmediate action is necessary to ensure fair compensation in order to stop the imminent loss of generators with on-site fuel supplies, and thereby preserve the benefits of generation diversity and avoid the severe consequences that additional shut-downs would have on the electric grid — Energy Department Grid Resiliency Pricing Rule propsal \nIn a comment to FERC, the environmental groups said another part of Perry's proposal also resembled Murray's memo. \n\"These photographs documenting Murray's request to DOE in language that mirrors the language ultimately used in the Proposal adds to the weight of evidence that the Proposal aims to benefit select companies rather than achieve legitimate statutory aims,\" the groups said. \nMurray responded in a letter to FERC, saying the comment was \"composed solely of lies, mistruths, and reckless and inaccurate speculation.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T23:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T23:38:08.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The answer, provided Tuesday by Eastman Kodak , is KodakCoin.\nThe iconic company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012 after fumbling the shift to digital images. Now it's betting its future on digital currencies with an initial coin offering designed to help photographers sell their work.

It refocused around digital printing, packaging and a legacy film business that's a shadow of the glory days when Paul Simon had a hit song rhapsodizing about Kodachrome. None of those has caught on. Sales fell by a third in the first three years after bankruptcy. They dropped another 8 percent in the first three quarters of 2017, to $1.1 billion, and the bottom line dipped into the red. The company's market cap, nearly $30 billion at its peak in the late 1990s, fell to just $135 million early this week.\nThe announcement of the planned blockchain platform and initial coin offering changed the stock's trajectory on the day.

In December, stock in tiny Long Island Iced Tea tripled after it renamed itself Long Blockchain .\nStartups raised more than $3 billion with ICOs last year, led by Filecoin, a blockchain data-storage network that raked in $257 million. Yet the field is growing crowded.

The company has been looking for assets to sell to pay down some of its $845 million in debt, according to Eikon data.

The speculation started with the Bank of Japan, but all central banks are expected to take a tighter stance towards monetary policy. The U.S. 10-year yield rose to 2.55 percent, the highest since March. 6 Hours Ago | 06:37 \nThe bond market is getting a wake-up call from global central banks that the post-financial crisis era of easy money and super low interest rates is coming to an end. \nIn what was a sizzling move for the Treasury market, the 10-year yield zipped higher Tuesday amid talk that the Bank of Japan could finally be ready to wind down its easy policies. The 10-year yield broke above the key 2.50 percent level and was trading as high as 2.55 percent, the highest since March. \nThe 10-year is key since it is a benchmark that mortgages and many other consumer and business loans are based on. \nStrategists said as the market fixated on the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank was also a focus. The ECB cut its bond buying in half as of last week, and there is increasing speculation it could cut back altogether before the end of the year. Both central banks are well behind the Fed which has already raised interest rates five times and has been unwinding its balance sheet. \nWhile still down the road, moves to limit easing would put both of those central banks closer to the time when they begin to adjust interest rates to more normal levels. The Bank of Japan Tuesday bought fewer longer duration bonds than it has been purchasing, sparking the speculation its program is coming to an end. However, strategists said the changes could be more technical than an indication the central bank is about to change course. \n\"I have argued the Bank of Japan and ECB set long end interest rates in this county as much as the Fed does. Our long end interest rates can move higher. I think the 10-year Treasury is going to hit significantly higher interest rates than they are now,\" said Rick Rieder, global chief investment officer, fixed income at BlackRock. \"We think the 10-year this year is going to 3 percent. I still hold to that.\" \nThe 10-year yield has run up quickly and was trading at 2.44 percent at the beginning of the year. \n\"For what has been a very low volatility market, this is a big day,\" said Rieder. The 10-year was at 2.54 percent in late trading. \nThe U.S. 10-year yield has been in a flattening trend —moving closer to the 2-year yield, which has been rising on the prospect of Fed interest rate hikes. But the 10-year has also been held down because of low interest rates in other part of the world that make U.S. yields look more attractive. Yields move opposite price. \n\"I think it started with Japan. Obviously, they're not making any huge shifts in their monetary policy, but this is a movement in that direction of removing some of the accommodation. It's taken global central banks many years to build this up. It's not going to be removed very quickly. Nonethess, it's going to put upward pressure on rates,\" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management. \nRieder said the market move also comes as inflation appears to be picking up and more Treasury and global sovereign debt is coming to market. Meanwhile, those major central bank bond purchases by the Fed and others are slowing down. \n\"There's at least $1 trillion reduction between the Fed and the ECB this year. That's significant,\" said Peter Boocvkar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group. \nMark Cabana, head of U.S. short rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said there were other factors that impacted yields Tuesday. \"We also had China come out and suggest they're going to stop relying on a counter cyclical factor in their fixing of the yuan. On net, that means China needs to rely less on intervention in order to support the yuan and that would mean on net, less U.S. dollars and less U.S. dollar investment,\" like Treasurys, said Cabana. \nCabana said Tuesday's move was significant but whether it indicates a turn in the market is yet to be seen. \"It's too soon to tell. The fact we have broken above 2.50 clearly is certainly something we''ve not done for almost a year and it very well may be leading to higher overall levels of rates,\" he said. \nCabana said Fed officials may also have contributed to the market move with talk of moving to a policy of price level targeting rather than using a target for inflation. The difference would be the target price levels would be set for a specific period of time. Cabana said the result could be fewer near term rate increases as inflation builds up.

SHARES \nAt the start of the fall semester in 2015, University of Pennsylvania classmates Stephen Kuhl and Kabeer Chopra were grabbing drinks at The Franklin Mortgage & Investment Company, a Philadelphia speakeasy. The friends were griping about something many college students, urban-dwellers and couch potatoes can relate to — the hefty price and hassle that comes with buying a new couch. \nHaving moved to the area to attend Wharton business school, Kuhl had recently purchased a sofa and was frustrated by the experience — there was the two-hour round-trip trek in a rented van to a New Jersey IKEA, the $600 price tag and the two-and-a-half hours spent putting it together. \nChopra was equally fed up by a saga involving a West Elm couch: He waited for a sale to buy one and was then told that for the medium-gray fabric he wanted, he would have to wait 12 weeks for delivery. Instead he settled for a color that was in stock: orange. To avoid paying for shipping, Chopra went to the store with a dolly and wheeled it home himself, pushing it for two blocks along a city sidewalk. \n\"We were talking about these experiences with each other and we thought, 'You know, maybe there's a better way to do this,'\" Kuhl, now 30, tells CNBC Make It . \"There are so many companies that have improved the experience in buying products by selling them directly to customers online…Why can't we do that with couches?\" \nInspired, Kuhl and Chopra decided to use the idea as a project for their entrepreneurship class. They spent their first semester at Wharton researching why a convenient, affordable and high-quality couch didn't exist, and found that the problem was the high cost of shipping such big, bulky items, which couldn't be stacked on top of each other. \nThe issue seemed surmountable, so the pair decided to look for a solution. \nWorking between classes from Chopra's apartment or at Huntsman Hall on campus, Kuhl drew elementary sketches of what a more delivery-friendly couch might look like: It would need cushions that could be compression sealed; a hinge in the couch would allow the backrest to fold down; and the legs would need to be removable. Plus the modules of the couch would have to be easily assembled without any tools, while still being sturdy. \nSome of Kuhl's original sketches \nKuhl and Chopra hired a furniture designer as well as an engineering firm that had experience making everything from Apple products to helicopters to create prototype after prototype. \n\"We reverse-engineered a high-quality couch to ship in compact boxes that fit within the FedEx and UPS commercial weight guidelines,\" Kuhl says. \n\"Instead of having a couch that costs several hundred dollars to ship from the factory to the warehouse to the retail store to the customer,\" he explains, they designed one that could ship anywhere in the U.S., straight from the factory, for less than $100. Getting creative about money \nIf only turning their dream into a reality was as affordable as their couches were meant to be. \n\"Neither Kabeer or I had any money,\" Kuhl says of his co-founder, also 30. \"We were accruing a lot of debt in business school, so we knew early on we had to get a lot of outside capital.\" \nIn the spring of 2016, they started with an initial round of funding from friends and family, raising $330,000. \nIt was an unusually painless experience. \"It kind of led me into a false sense of 'Oh, fundraising is easy,' because a lot of my friends and former bosses were just like, 'Look, you wouldn't be asking me for money unless you really believe in this, and I believe that you will do everything in your power to make this successful,'\" he recalls. \"So that was very rewarding.\" \nThe business partners were also able to attract the interest of Y Combinator — a start-up accelerator — early on, which invested $120,000. \nStill, Kuhl and Chopra had to be frugal. So they worked with people who believed in the vision enough to be \"financially flexible\": They found a law firm to do their basic start-up legal work that was willing to be paid at a later date. And their furniture designer agreed to a small sum up front. \n\"Starting a company is an exercise in being super creative about getting things accomplished with little to no money,\" Kuhl says. Couch-in-a-box becomes a reality \nBurrow , a name that they liked because it invoked a sense of comfort and coziness, was on its way. \nFor the next year, the co-founders were faced with balancing business school and their budding business. They spent the summer of 2016 splitting time between Y Combinator in California and making trips to their manufacturing facility in Mexico. \nAfter months of work, the entrepreneurs delivered 15 prototypes, mostly to people they knew. Kuhl recalls baggage-checking the very first couch, a three-seater, in a box on a plane from Mexico City and delivering it in an UberXL. \n\"The very first one delivered in late July, which is we were really proud of,\" Kuhl says. \"Kabeer was told he had to wait 12 weeks for the couch he wanted from West Elm. From the time we incorporated Burrow in April 2016 to when we delivered in late July of 2016, that was 12 weeks. We were proud of that.\" \nThe partners decided on a core design in October of 2016 and Burrow officially launched in April 2017. \nBurrow couches, which you order online, are modular, so they can be made bigger or smaller by adding or subtracting pieces. Prices range from $495 for an armchair to $1,745 for a four-seater with a chaise.

Were working hard on the farm bill and I think its going to go well. \nIn May Trump angered farm groups, which represent the rural voters who generally support his Republican Party, when he proposed cutting $46.54 billion in federal agricultural funding, mostly by capping the amount the government chips in toward crop insurance. There currently is no limit to the support the government gives farmers for insurance premiums. \nTrump, who swept Tennessee in the 2016 election, also signed an executive order after the speech to make it easier for the private sector to locate broadband infrastructure on federal land and buildings, part of a push to expand high-speed internet in rural America. \nTrump signed a memorandum directing the Interior Department to support rural broadband development by increasing access to tower facilities managed by the department, the White House said. \nFaster internet speeds in rural areas are often considered key to addressing the economic divide between rural and urban America, but the costs have so far been prohibitive. \nAbout 39 percent of rural Americans lack access to high- speed internet service, the Federal Communications Commission said in a 2016 report. \n\"We need to get rural America more connected. We need it for our tractors, we need it for our schools, we need it for our home-based businesses,\" a White House official told reporters ahead of Trump's speech. \nThe White House described the moves as an incremental step to help spur private development while the administration figures out how it can help with funding, something that could become part of Trump's plan to invest in infrastructure. \nThe CEO of the leading telecommunications trade group in the country, Jonathan Spalter, said USTelecom would push to ensure the government sets aside money for helping build and upgrade network infrastructure, as well as dismantling and streamlining regulations.

Published 1 Hour Ago SHARES Chris Carlson | AP U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents serve an employment audit notice at a 7-Eleven convenience store Wednesday, Jan. 10, 2018, in Los Angeles. Agents said they targeted about 100 7-Eleven stores nationwide Wednesday to open employment audits and interview workers. \nU.S. immigration agents descended on dozens of 7-Eleven stores before dawn Wednesday to open employment audits and interview workers in what officials described as the largest operation against an employer under Donald Trump 's presidency. \nAgents targeted about 100 stores nationwide, broadening an investigation that began with a 4-year-old case against a franchisee on New York 's Long Island. The audits could lead to criminal charges or fines over the stores' hiring practices. \nThe action appears to open a new front in Trump's sharp expansion of immigration enforcement, which has already brought a 40 percent increase in deportation arrests and plans to spend billions of dollars on a border wall with Mexico . Hardliners have been pressing for a tougher stance on employers. \nDerek Benner, a top official at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told The Associated Press that Wednesday's operation was \"the first of many\" and \"a harbinger of what's to come\" for employers. He said there would be more employment audits and investigations, though there is no numerical goal. show chapters 1:46 PM ET Tue, 9 Jan 2018 | 02:35 \n\"This is what we're gearing up for this year and what you're going to see more and more of is these large-scale compliance inspections, just for starters. From there, we will look at whether these cases warrant an administrative posture or criminal investigation,\" said Benner, acting head of ICE's Homeland Security Investigations, which oversees cases against employers. \n\"It's not going to be limited to large companies or any particular industry, big medium and small,\" he said. \"It's going to be inclusive of everything that we see out there.\" \n7-Eleven Stores Inc., based in Irving, Texas, with more than 8,600 stores in the U.S., didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment. \nThough agents arrested 21 people suspected of being in the country illegally during Wednesday's sweep, the action was aimed squarely at management. \nIllegal hiring is rarely prosecuted, partly because investigations are time-consuming and convictions are difficult to achieve because employers can claim they were duped by fraudulent documents or intermediaries. Administrative fines are discounted by some as a business cost. \nGeorge W. Bush 's administration aggressively pursued criminal investigations against employers in its final years with dramatic pre-dawn shows of force and large numbers of worker arrests. In 2008, agents arrived by helicopter at the Agriprocessors meatpacking plant in Postville, Iowa, and detained nearly 400 workers. Last month, Trump commuted the 27-year prison sentence of Sholom Rubashkin, former chief executive of what was the nation's largest kosher meatpacking operation. \nBarack Obama 's administration more than doubled employer audits to more than 3,100 a year in 2013, shunning Bush's flashier approach. John Sandweg, an acting ICE director under Obama, said significant fines instilled fear in employers and draining resources from other enforcement priorities. \nTrump is pursuing \"its own kind of unique strategy\" tied to its broader emphasis on fighting illegal immigration, including enforcement on the border, Benner said. Some workers may get arrested in the operations but authorities are targeting employers because they are job magnets for people to come to the country illegally. \n\"We need to make sure that employers are on notice that we are going to come out and ensure that they're being compliant,\" Benner said \"For those that don't, we're going to take some very aggressive steps in terms of criminal investigations to make sure that we address them and hold them accountable.\" \nWednesday's operation resulted from a 2013 investigation that resulted in charges against nine 7-Eleven franchisees and managers in New York and Virginia. Eight have pleaded guilty and were ordered to pay more than $2.6 million in back wages, and the ninth was arrested in November. \nIn the 2013 investigations, managers used more than 25 stolen identities to employ at least 115 people in the country illegally, knowing they could pay below minimum wage, according to court documents. The documents say 7-Eleven corporate office does automated payroll, requiring franchisees provide employee names and Social Security numbers to pay workers through direct deposit or check. \nThe 7-Eleven stores served on Wednesday will be required to produce documents showing they required work authorization, which Benner said will become more common. Audits may lead to criminal charges or administrative penalties. \nIn Los Angeles' Koreatown, seven agents arriving in three unmarked cars closed a store for 20 minutes to explain the audit to the only employee there, a clerk with a valid green card. Agents, wearing blue jackets marked ICE, told arriving customers that the store was closed briefly for a federal inspection. A driver delivering cases of beer was told to wait in the parking lot. \nThe manager was in Bangladesh and the owner, reached by phone, told the clerk to accept whatever documents were served. Agents said they would return Tuesday for employment records they requested. \nNeither 7-Eleven nor was its parent company, Seven & i Holding . based in Tokyo, was charged in that case. \n\"Just as the IRS performs audits of people all the time of their tax returns, the same purpose here is to ensure a culture of compliance in this area,\" he said.

Look at your cash flow \nThe first step is \"to really know where you're at financially,\" says Michelle Brownstein , a certified financial planner at Personal Capital , \"meaning how much you're earning, how much you're saving , or, if you're not saving, how much you're actually spending every month. \n\"If you don't know where your money is going, it's impossible to put together any kind of plan to achieve your goal.\" \nYou'll also want to check your credit score , which will affect the interest rate on your mortgage. Good credit can mean significantly lower monthly payments , so if your score isn't great, consider taking some time to improve it before home shopping. show chapters 12:22 PM ET Mon, 24 April 2017 | 00:49 2. Figure out how much home you can afford \nA good rule of thumb is to make sure you don't spend more than 28 percent of your gross income on housing in any given month, says Brownstein. Keep in mind that monthly payments encompass more than just the mortgage; they also include interest, property taxes and insurance on the home. \nWhen determining your budget, \"it's easier to work backwards than to say, 'OK I want a house that's $1 million,'\" she tells CNBC Make It. \"You don't want to put yourself in a situation where you buy more house that you can afford.\" 3. Build up your emergency fund \n\"It's always important, from a broader financial planning standpoint, to have an emergency fund ,\" says Brownstein, but it's particularly important for homeowners, who no longer have a super to deal with roof leaks, broken appliances or other pricey repairs: \"Going from renting to owning is a big adjustment because all of a sudden you can't call your landlord if the washing machine breaks. You have to pay for it.\" \nShe recommends having between three and six months' worth of your day-to-day living expenses stashed away. That means, if you spend $4,000 a month, you'll want to have between $12,000 and $24,000 in cash to fall back on. show chapters 1:16 PM ET Tue, 27 June 2017 | 01:03 4. Get together a down payment \nTechnically, you don't always have to put money down when financing a home today, and how much you decide to put down is highly personal. But the smaller the down payment , the larger the mortgage loan and the more you'll pay in interest. \n\"Generally speaking, 20 percent is a good amount to put down,\" Brownstein tells CNBC Make It. Anything lower and you will have to pay for private mortgage insurance (PMI), which is a safety net for the bank in case you fail to make your payments. \nPMI, which can cost between one percent and two percent of your loan amount , will be added to your monthly mortgage if you don't have 20 percent equity in your home. 5. Plan for surprises \nThe down payment isn't the only necessary factor you need to budget for, since buying a home comes with expenses such as property taxes, insurance, closing costs, moving costs and maintenance. \n\"Depending on where you live in the country, you should always find out if your city or state assesses property tax,\" says Brownstein. \"There are some areas that assess both a county tax and a state tax, so it's good to be aware of that on the front end.\" \nIn terms of planning ahead for maintenance and repairs, while shopping around, you'll want to ask when the appliances were purchased and installed so you'll have a better idea of when they'll need to be replaced. \n\"If you're buying a house that's a bit older, that can come with its own issues as well, whether it's poor heating or poor insulation that needs to be redone,\" notes Brownstein. Ultimately, the cost of repairs and maintenance can represent 10-to-20 percent of the price of the home each year. \nWhen you get to the point where you're ready to close on a house, you'll want to be prepared for closing costs such as appraisal fees, attorney fees, title insurance and inspection fees, which can run you two-to-five percent of the total cost of the home . \nThe expenses don't end at closing. You should also budget for moving costs, which vary but can set you back a couple thousand dollars . show chapters 9:15 AM ET Tue, 14 March 2017 | 00:53 6. Get pre-approved for a mortgage \nA pre-approval analyzes your creditworthiness, tells you how much you can borrow from your lender and, ultimately, can make all the difference between winning a bid or not . \nOnce you're pre-approved for a mortgage loan, start hunting for places within your price range. A real estate agent, and sites like Zillow , Trulia and Redfin , can help you with the process. \nAfter determining your basic home requirements — where you want to live, how many bedrooms and bathrooms you need and whether you want a specific school district — Brownstein suggests making a list of your \"deal breakers\" and \"must haves,\" which will help you narrow your search. \nMost importantly, stick to your budget. \"The key is to be really firm on the very top end of your budget and refuse to look at anything that's priced above it,\" says Brownstein. At the end of the day, \"it's much better to be able to upgrade your house than it is to realize you bought way more house than you could afford to the point where it's impacting your ability to live other parts of your life.\" 7. Get to know the neighborhood \nBesides buying more home than you can afford, one of the biggest mistakes first time homebuyers make is \"buying in an area that you don't fully explore,\" says Brownstein. \"Actually go walk around the neighborhood, and not just during the day — go there at night. Make sure you feel safe and good about it.\" \nAfter all, one of the most important factors to consider when settling down is the actual location of your home, says Brownstein: \"You can buy a brand new condo in a great building, but if it's in a terrible neighborhood with no amenities and you can't have the lifestyle you want, you're in the wrong place.\" \nUltimately, you can always change the finishing of your home, she notes, but you can't change the location. show chapters 1:00 PM ET Fri, 31 March 2017 | 00:51 8. Offer something you're comfortable with and close \nShopping for a home can be a draining process. Don't put in an offer because you're desperate to be done. On the flip side, be wary of buying with your heart and not your head — getting too emotionally involved can lead to spending more than you can afford. \nOnce you're ready to make an offer on a home within your budget, bid.

The company also said Windows Server performance will be degraded if customers choose to install updates that are meant to protect against untrusted code. SHARES Getty Images \nMicrosoft on Tuesday provided new details on the performance impact of updates to protect against recently disclosed security vulnerabilities. In certain cases, performance on Windows will be significantly slowed by patches for the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities . \nSome people have found that their servers and PCs are performing differently after installing updates, so the news shouldn't come as a big surprise. Still, the new information doesn't line up perfectly well with what Intel said last week when the vulnerabilities were first officially announced. \"Any performance impacts are workload-dependent, and, for the average computer user, should not be significant,\" the chipmaker said . \nMicrosoft expects most people using Windows 7 and Windows 8 on chips that are from 2015 or older will notice performance degradations, Terry Myerson, executive vice president for Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group, wrote in a blog post . The company did not publish specific performance benchmarks to back up the claims. \nSome people using Windows 10 with Intel Haswell chips or anything older will notice performance impacts, Myerson wrote. But those people running Windows 10 on Skylake, Kaby Lake or newer Intel chips probably won't notice performance issues, although internally run benchmarks show single-digit slowdowns, Myerson wrote. \nThe case is different for Windows Server, Microsoft's operating system for servers. Should customers choose to install updates to protect against issues stemming from untrusted code running on those machines, there will be a more significant performance impact, Myerson wrote. \"This is why you want to be careful to evaluate the risk of untrusted code for each Windows Server instance, and balance the security versus performance tradeoff for your environment,\" he wrote. \nAt this point, Microsoft has provided Meltdown and Spectre patches for 41 of the 45 versions of Windows through Windows Update, Myerson wrote. \nIntel stock went down after Microsoft released the news. It traded as low as $43.75, about 2 percent lower than opening price, falling from about $44.34 per share immediately after the announcement. Microsoft stock initially faltered but then reversed its decline. \nLater on Tuesday Intel offered new details on PC performance impacts because of security updates. \n\"Based on our most recent PC benchmarking, we continue to expect that the performance impact should not be significant for average computer users. This means the typical home and business PC user should not see significant slowdowns in common tasks such as reading email, writing a document or accessing digital photos,\" Intel said in a statement . The testing on PCs with the latest Intel silicon found an impact of 6 percent or less, the company said. \nIntel said it's still trying to get a sense of performance changes for chips used in data centers.

After months of perfecting her theoretical concept and her physical prototype, Rao traveled with her parents to the 3M headquarters in Minnesota and gave a five-minute speech in front a panel of judges, followed by a five-minute question and answer session. \nBrian Barnhart, a school superintendent and one of the judges, told ABC , \"It's not hyperbole to say she really blew us out of the water.\" Rao was named America's Top Young Scientist and handed a check for $25,000. \nScience is not Rao's only passion. \"I actually love business,\" she says. \"I like inventing, I like researching but I also like marketing.\" She's developing a business model that she hopes will make Tethys financially accessible for all families. \n\"I would like to make it commercially available, after performing last-minute tests, so that it is in everybody's hands, because I think it's important to test our water,\" she says. \"Currently, the device costs $20, but when it's manufactured in bulk, it will cost significantly less.\" show chapters 5:32 PM ET Thu, 13 Oct 2016 | 01:15 \nNow that Rao has some prize money in her pocket, she plans to invest in her business, her community and her education. \n\"With most of it, I plan to continue evolving my device, like manufacturing chemically doped carbon nanotubes and again performing more false/positive tests,\" says Rao. \"And with the rest of it, I plan to give back to the organizations that I volunteer for, such as Children's Kindness Network, and I would also love to put some of it into college funds.\" \n\"When I grew up I want to be an epidemiologist or a geneticist,\" she says. In the meantime, Rao finds joy and pride in being an inventor — and is keeping busy in seventh grade. \n\"I think that being an inventor-slash-scientist is pretty much like a superhero,\" she says. \"What do superheroes do?

Steve Bannon said Donald Trump \"lost his stuff\"; the president observed of his disheveled ex-strategist: \"Guy looks homeless.\"\nAnd now, politically speaking, he is.\nBreitbart News, the outrage-stoking far-right website that Bannon made his personal power base, cut ties with him today . Bannon's savage portrayal of the White House made the outcome inevitable. In this civil war, Breitbart and its financiers had no choice but to side with the president of the United States.\nThat represents welcome news for Republican Congressional leaders who never shared Bannon's initial enthusiasm for Trump. After being deposed as chief White House strategist a few months ago, Bannon returned to Breitbart and vowed to lead a 2018 insurrection against \"establishment\" Republicans he described as thwarting the president's nationalist \"Make America Great Again\" agenda.\nBannon's insurrection suffered one painful defeat when his candidate for U.S. Senate in Alabama, accused child molester Roy Moore, lost a race Republicans thought they couldn't lose. Now Bannon has lost the backing of the Mercer family's billions that he had counted on for weaponry.\nThat hardly solves the political problems Republicans face this year as they try to hold their House and Senate majorities. Early polling shows Democrats with powerful momentum, despite a strong economy, booming financial markets, and the freshly-enacted tax-cut law.\nThat's partly due to political tides that nearly always recede for the party that holds the White House. And it's partly due to Trump's extraordinary unpopularity, which has repelled key blocs of the electorate including young people, women and college-educated whites.\nA growing number of Republican lawmakers are choosing to retire rather than trying to ride out the 2018 storms. For those vulnerable Republicans intent on staying, strategies for mitigating the damage are limited.\nOne option is distancing themselves from the president, as some embattled members did when Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama faced midterm political troubles. But doing so risks splintering their base with primary challenges from the Trump loyalists on the right, even with Bannon marginalized.\nWolff's book \"Fire and Fury,\" depicting Trump as uninformed, unstable and childlike, has amplified public discussion of the president's fitness for office. \"Never Trump\" conservative intellectuals sought to drive home that message throughout the 2016 campaign, as retiring Republican Sens. Bob Corker and Jeff Flake have in recent months.\nBut so far, neither GOP Congressional leaders nor rank-and-file party loyalists have picked up the theme. Barring devastating developments soon from special counsel Robert Mueller 's Russia investigation, Trump isn't going anywhere.\nAnd that makes the GOP's choice on standing by Trump much like Breitbart's between Bannon and the president: not much of a choice at all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T02:16:45.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Once that happens, Alabama could become the fourth biggest state in the U.S. when it comes to manufacturing new vehicles. It's currently tied for fifth, with Tennessee, in annual auto production, according to the Center for Automotive Research, which tracks vehicle manufacturing in the U.S. \"With this announcement, our world changes overnight,\" said Tommy Battle, the mayor of Huntsville. \"It vaults Alabama to the top as an industry leader in producing the next generation of cars that will power our nation.\" That may be a bit of an exaggeration. Data from the Center for Automotive Research shows Michigan built 19 percent of the vehicles manufactured in the U.S. last year. That is more than double the production in Alabama. \nSo why is a state with 4.8 million people becoming more attractive for auto manufacturers and suppliers? It's all about location. \"This plant is going to be in the center of auto alley,\" said Thomas Klier, senior economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Klier has studied America's shifting auto manufacturing footprint and says Alabama benefits from being so close to other Toyota facilities. \n\"It's a very sensible location,\" he said. \"Toyota has an engine plant in Huntsville and two other facilities nearby in Mississippi, so this makes sense.\" \"Our investment to establish a new vehicle assembly plant with Mazda builds on the strong success we have enjoyed in Alabama where we produce engines for the North American market,\" said Toyota President Akio Toyoda. Meanwhile, Mazda will become the latest automaker to establish a final assembly plant in the U.S. \"We hope to work, learn and grow together with the people of Alabama and Huntsville,\" said Masamichi Kogai, president and CEO of Mazda Motor. \nMazda plans to build an SUV at the new facility as the Japanese automaker moves to improve a model line-up that has historically relied more on cars than utility vehicles.

The report comes as rates were already rising on concerns that the Fed and other central banks were tightening policy and governments, including the U.S., were issuing a pile of new debt.\nStrategists say, however, that they do not expect China to sell Treasurys or do much to damage the market where it is the biggest holder. If China does abstain from purchasing Treasurys this year, U.S. interest rates on the margin could rise more than expected. Currently, strategists mostly see the key yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury topping out at about 3 percent.\nThe Trump administration is expected to issue two key trade decisions on steel and aluminum later this month, both of which could affect China. Worries about protectionist trade practices around NAFTA and China have been a major risk factor for financial markets.\n\"It's hard to know how much credibility to assign to [the report,] but it probably originates from somewhere and as a result I think the market is interpreting this as a potential shift in strategy,\" said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \"It's hard to know how much of this is politics, which certainly seems to be some piece of this given the report cited political developments, such as trade disputes. It does seem politically motivated.\"\nCabana has expected Treasurys to be under pressure this quarter due in part to increased supply, and less demand from overseas would fit that scenario.\n\"We're of the view if you're a reserve manager, Treasurys aren't terribly attractive. If you're China, you don't have too many options, but this could certainly mean they could diversify into euros more or in U.S. dollar terms, hold more in cash,\" he said.\nChina has foreign reserves of about $3.1 trillion, and the U.S. government reported it held $1.189 trillion in Treasurys as of October. Those holdings are below the five-year average of $1.226 trillion, according to Cabana.\n\"No one has come out and denied it as far as I can tell,\" said George Goncalves, head of fixed income strategy at Nomura. \"It does seem it was some sort of messaging.\"\nWhen the report hit, Treasury yields, already in an upswing, moved higher with the 10-year yield reaching 2.597 percent, its highest since March 15. The U.S. dollar weakened, losing 1 percent against the yen and 0.3 percent against the euro.\n\"This is not the death knell for the dollar. It is not even the fatal blow for the Treasury market. It's just a reminder that we are dependent on overseas investors,\" Goncavles said.\nStrategists said the market is taking the comment seriously despite the fact that there is no named source in the story. But the story did gain some credibility because it followed a report Tuesday that China was dropping a currency adjustment mechanism, which could make it less reliant on intervention to support the yuan and therefore require less dollar investment.\nEven without the political element, China may see U.S. Treasurys as simply less attractive. \"Is there value buying the bond market when there's potential for inflation moving higher, and we're doing a lot of fiscal spending, at a time when the economy is near full employment? We're going to issue new debt. Like any debtholder around the world, you look up and say: 'Are you being fiscally responsible?'\" said Goncalves.\nCabana said U.S. debt issuance is expected to rise by $550 billion in 2018, or 1.7 times as much as last year. That is to help pay for the U.S. tax cuts that went into law Jan. 1 and the increase in entitlement costs.\nAlan Ruskin, head of G10 foreign exchange strategy at Deutsche Bank, said he sees limited impact from the China comments. \"There are some good arguments why China's bark will prove a lot worse than its bite,\" he said, noting in the five-year sector, U.S. yields are better than alternatives.\nThat is a sector central banks favor, and the U.S. yield is superior to the negative 20 basis points on German debt, or the negative 8 on Japanese debt.\n\"Most [of] these alternative markets are also far behind the US in finding a soft-landing exit from extreme monetary accommodation, making future potential capital losses a worrying factor,\" Ruskin wrote. \"The only G10 countries that can compete are Canada, Australia and NZ, but it's hard to see how China can start shifting much of its $1.2 trillion Treasuries, without being hugely disruptive to much less liquid markets over the short and medium term.\"\nHe noted that China holds so much U.S. debt that any small action would damage its existing stock of assets and its portfolio.\n\"During the 2008 crisis, China appeared to fully understand the ramifications of its potential selling of Treasuries and did not become a disruptive force for USD fixed income, even as [Treasury capital flow] data showed a shift from agencies into very short-term T-Bills,\" Ruskin added.\nAt Jefferies, Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist, noted that if China stops buying Treasurys, the market could suffer.\n\"Treasury financing needs are going to rise significantly in 2018 and beyond relative to recent history, so Treasury is going to be looking for as many sources of demand as they can find,\" he wrote. \"China turning away from the market potentially makes Treasury's job harder. However, this prospect might already be old news since there is evidence that China has not been a big buyer of Treasuries for several years now.\"\nHe noted that from January 2007 through July 2011, Chinese holdings of Treasury notes and bonds rose from $401 billion to $1.315 trillion. But since that time, Chinese holdings have fallen to $1.189 trillion and touched as low as $1.049 trillion in January 2017.\nSource: Courtesy of Jefferies", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T19:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T20:27:40.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Age only made the problem worse. A few years ago, a medical professional recommended Judy use a footstool to raise her knees while on the toilet.\nShe tried it, and it worked. \"It's just a world of difference,\" she said. Her husband, Bill, was amazed. \"We both thought, 'Wow, we're in our 60s, why are we just now hearing about this?'\"\nBut the footstool wasn't perfect, and so Bobby — a self-described gypsy forever looking to make a \"big splash\" — saw a business opportunity. \"There was nothing out there on the market that we could find to help us solve the problem. So we made it.\"\nJeniece Pettitt | CNBC Squatty Potty has a variety of options for sale including this wooden stool They made the first stool out of wood and named it the Squatty Potty, based on what they heard traditional hole-in-the-ground toilets in China were called. Other potential names included \"The Health Step,\" \"The S--- Shelf\" and \"The Stool Stool.\"\nBobby said squatting is the way humans are supposed to, well, poop. \"We all have a kink in our colon,\" he said. \"It's there to maintain continence. Otherwise we'd be crapping our pants wherever we go.\" Sitting on a toilet relaxes the kink to a point, but squatting opens everything up for better evacuation. \"Most of your problems with your colon start where that kink is,\" said his father, Bill.\nJeniece Pettitt | CNBC The Squatty Potty tucks right in to most toilets. The family began giving footstools to friends, who considered them gag gifts, until they started using them. \"I saw the results, and I saw the effect on people, and I'm like, 'There really is something here,'\" said Bobby. So he and his parents and one other brother took $35,000 to set up a website and begin manufacturing for real.\nJudy decided the stools needed to be made out of plastic to bring down the price, and they placed their first large order. \"The first order was like 2,000 Squatty Potties. They arrived from China, and we got this big container full,\" said Bobby. \"I was like, 'What? We are never going to sell these,' right? Now we sell that many a day.\"\nJeniece Pettitt | CNBC The founders of Squatty Potty. Bobby, Judy and Bill Edwards. In the beginning, Bobby sent free Squatty Potties to health bloggers to generate buzz, and success has flowed with more regularity than Metamucil. Dr. Oz's show called (Bill Edwards thought it was a crank call from his kids), and then Howard Stern started talking about the product.\nFinally, on their second try, Squatty Potty qualified for \"Shark Tank.\" They sold $1 million in product within 24 hours of the TV appearance, and the company also received a $350,000 investment from Lori Greiner, which led to high-profile shelf space in Bed Bath & Beyond .\nFirst-year sales in 2011 were $17,000. Sales hit a whopping $19 million in 2015. And by the end of 2017, they reached nearly $33 million. \"We're going to probably hit $100 million within the next few years,\" said Judy.\nIn the past year, the company has developed new products like a toilet plunger incorporating the poo emoji and a line of toilet deodorant sprays. The Edwards have expanded operations in Utah and added a new plant in Canada to focus on international sales.\nThe biggest challenge has always been finding a marketing balance between humor and health. \"You can get really gross, or you can get so ambiguous that people don't know what you're talking about,\" said Bobby.\nThe Squatty Potty YouTube ad is a good example. It stars a Prince Charming character and a unicorn that poops ice cream. \"This is where your ice cream comes from,\" says the prince. \"(Unicorns) are good at pooping, but you know who sucks at pooping? You do.\"\nWhen first presented with the idea for the video, the Edwards family thought it was too cheeky and too expensive. \"We're talking about a subject nobody wants to talk about,\" said Judy, \"and if a unicorn, or anything, is going to show poop, we don't want it to be poop, we want it to be something that people like and enjoy.\"\nHence, the ice cream. \"It's not OK to talk about poop, but it's OK to talk about ice cream,\" said Bill.\nThey eventually decided to spend $250,000 to make the ad. At last count, it had over 100 million views, and sales have surged. \"We're going to make more videos, and they're going to cost a lot more than that,\" Bill laughed.\nJeniece Pettitt | CNBC Bobby Edwards demonstrates how the Squatty Potty works. Squatty Potty has run into a couple of hiccups. In May 2017, the company dropped Kathy Griffin as a spokeswoman after her infamous photo with a fake severed head of Donald Trump.\nAlso, after releasing their new SquattyPottymus for kids last fall, they recalled the top portion — the \"hat\" — after receiving reports of two children slipping and hurting themselves. The rest of the unit continued to sell well through the holidays.\nUltimately, the success has been stunning. Judy Edwards originally thought they might just sell a few Squatty Potties here or there to help supplement their retirement income, because no one likes to discuss pooping problems.\n\"I still am embarrassed to talk about it,\" she said. Not nearly as embarrassed as she used to be.\nLearn more about the founders of Squatty Potty in CNBC's new podcast: Strange Success , which you can listen to on Apple Podcasts.\nDisclosure: CNBC owns the exclusive off-network cable rights to \"Shark Tank.\" This is an update of a previously published article.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T16:19:24.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Burned-over zones are especially susceptible to destructive mudslides because scorched earth doesn't absorb water well and the land is easily eroded when there are no shrubs.\nThe torrent arrived suddenly and with a sound some likened to a freight train as water carrying rocks and trees washed away cars and trashed homes.\nThomas Tighe said he stepped outside his Montecito home in the middle of the night and heard \"a deep rumbling, an ominous sound I knew was ... boulders moving as the mud was rising.\"\nTwo cars were missing from his driveway and he watched two others slowly move sideways down the middle of the street \"in a river of mud.\"\nIn daylight, Tighe was shocked to see a body pinned by muck against his neighbor's home. He wasn't sure who it was.\nAuthorities had been bracing for the possibility of catastrophic flooding because of heavy rain in the forecast for the first time in 10 months.\nEvacuations were ordered beneath recently burned areas of Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties. But only an estimated 10 to 15 percent of people in a mandatory evacuation area of Santa Barbara County heeded the warning, authorities said.\nU.S. Highway 101, the link connecting Ventura and Santa Barbara, looked like a muddy river and was expected to be closed for two days.\nThe worst of the rainfall occurred in a 15-minute span starting at 3:30 a.m. Montecito got more than a half-inch in five minutes, while Carpinteria received nearly an inch in 15 minutes.\n\"All hell broke loose,\" said Peter Hartmann, a dentist who moonlights as a news photographer for the local website Noozhawk. \"Power lines were down, high-voltage power lines, the large aluminum poles to hold those were snapped in half.

The business was a side gig for the master of marinara, a way to create a permanent and ongoing source of funding for Newman's philanthropic work. From the start, the Hollywood star donated all of the company's profits to charities. In 2005 Newman's private foundation was set up and now it distributes the money. \nThe model was a success for decades. Newman's Own is now a $500 million enterprise, executives say. Its pasta sauces are a staple on grocery store shelves across the country, from the original traditional marinara to the zesty Sockarooni. The company's lineup includes salad dressing, lemonade and pet food. \nThe company's profits have allowed the foundation to expand its footprint around the world. It donated more than $30 million to more than 600 charities last year, with much of its giving focused on improving nutrition, helping children with life-threatening diseases and supporting veterans. \n\"It's not a tax break,\" Forrester said. \"This is more more like clemency, if you will. It allows us to continue to be in business and pay our corporate taxes.\" \nBut the model broke down after Newman died nearly a decade ago. U.S. tax law prohibits private foundations from owning more than a 20 percent stake in a for-profit company after the founder's death. The penalty for not complying is a 200 percent fine on the value of any additional holdings. \n\"The call it a tax … but the intent is obvious,\" said Jeff Brown, head of government affairs for the foundation. \nThe 1969 law was designed to target tax avoidance, but Newman's Own executives say no one envisioned at the time that anyone would want to start a company that gave away all its money – until Paul Newman came along. \nSince then, his work has inspired other entrepreneurs to establish similar models. About two dozen smaller philanthropic businesses are working with Newman's Own to urge lawmakers to find a solution. Robert and Ann Sacks run Fetch Eyewear in Portland, Oregon, and donate the proceeds to their nonprofit animal shelter, Pixie Project. The couple has appealed to Ron Wyden , Democratic U.S. senator from Oregon. \n\"The spirit is the same,\" Ann Sacks said. \"That got us involved with the Newman's Foundation to change the private foundation tax law.\" \nThe company had a five-year grace period after Newman's death to comply with the law. Once that was over, executives requested and received an additional five-year extension to come up with a solution. \nNow, time is almost expired. The deadline is in November, and executives say they must make a decision on the fate of the company by the end of the first quarter to meet it. \nThe law does not allow any more extensions. \n\"The problem that we have, obviously, is we don't have a lot of time,\" Forrester said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T18:36:17.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

James D. Morgan—Getty Images By Reuters 10:30 PM EST \nAustralia’s Qantas Airways (qubsf) said on Tuesday it had amended its website to no longer refer to Taiwan and Hong Kong as countries, rather than Chinese territories, after China issued a warning to foreign airlines last week. \nChina has stepped up efforts to police how foreign businesses refer to parts of China, or territories claimed by Beijing, including Taiwan and Hong Kong — even if only in pull-down menus on websites. \n“Due to an oversight, some Chinese territories were incorrectly listed as countries on parts of our website. We are correcting this error,” said Qantas in an emailed statement. \nChina’s civil aviation authority told foreign airlines to check their websites and make any needed changes, but the campaign goes beyond just airlines. \nChina last week suspended Marriott International’s (mar) Chinese website for a week to punish the world’s biggest hotel chain for listing Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as separate countries in a customer questionnaire. \nA Qantas spokeswoman did not immediately respond to questions as to whether the airline expected a similar action by the Chinese authorities. \nPublic apologies from Delta Air Lines (dal) , Zara and Medtronic (mdt) for similar offenses have so far satisfied China, which has grown increasingly sensitive to issues of sovereignty. \nQantas is the first Australian company to respond to Beijing’s heightened vigilance, though all firms exporting everything from iron ore to baby formula should be taking heed. \nFor more about China, watch Fortune’s video: \nChina, which is easily Australia’s biggest trading partner, bought A$93 billion ($73.98 billion) worth of Australian goods and services last year. \nHong Kong and Macau are former European colonies that are now part of China but run largely autonomously. China annexed Tibet in 1950, although Beijing has long claimed the Himalayan region has been an indivisible part of China throughout history. \nTaiwan is China’s most sensitive territorial issue. The ruling Communist Party considers the self-ruled, democratic island a wayward province and refuses to renounce the threat of force to bring it into the fold.

You want to know the truth, Dick, if we do this properly, DACA, you're not so far away from comprehensive immigration reform. And if you want to take it that further step, I'll take the heat. I don't care,\" said Trump. \n\"My positions are going to be what the people in this room come up with,\" the president later told the press pool. \"If they come to me with things I'm not in love with, I'm going to do it, because I respect them,\" said the president, flanked by Durbin and House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md. \nAfter the meeting Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he wants to handle a DACA solution and and government spending separately. \n\"It is still my view that I will call up a DACA-related immigration bill that I know the president will sign and that it will not be a part of any spending agreement,\" the Kentucky Republican said. \nFollowing the meeting, the White House also released a statement, saying the president and negotiators \"reached an agreement to negotiate legislation that accomplishes critically needed reforms in four high-priority areas: border security, chain migration, the visa lottery, and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy.\" \nTrump stressed that both Democrats and Republicans want to find a way to extend DACA protections, but he stressed that any such bill would need to end preferential immigration status for the family members of immigrants, and cancel the green card lottery program. \nTrump did not put as much emphasis Tuesday on building a wall along the southern border as he has at previous events, although he did mention erecting a barrier along \"a portion\" of it. This, along with his insistence that he would sign on to whatever deal congressional negotiators reach, is potentially a sign of progress in the tense negotiations. \nDemocrats have consistently said that appropriating billions of dollars to build a wall would be a nonstarter for talks, and they have threatened to withhold funding for the government, effectively forcing a shutdown, if Republicans continue to insist on funding for a wall as a condition of protecting approximately 800,000 so-called Dreamers: Undocumented young people who were brought to the United States as children. \nFormer President Barack Obama used an executive order to permit many Dreamers who completed high school to apply for work permits. Trump rescinded that order last fall, and gave Congress six months to come up with a fix before Dreamers would become eligible for deportation. \nThe press pool was permitted to stay in it for nearly an hour, far longer than reporters are usually allowed to film presidential meetings. The tone was collegial but energetic, with lawmakers from both parties taking turns expressing their positions, and Trump playing the role of an informed and engaged moderator. \n\"I know most of the people [in this room] on both sides, have a lot of respect for the people, on both sides, and what I approve is going to be very much reliant on what the people in this room come to me with. I have great confidence in these people,\" Trump said near the close of the meeting.

Were working hard on the farm bill and I think its going to go well. \nIn May Trump angered farm groups, which represent the rural voters who generally support his Republican Party, when he proposed cutting $46.54 billion in federal agricultural funding, mostly by capping the amount the government chips in toward crop insurance. There currently is no limit to the support the government gives farmers for insurance premiums. \nTrump, who swept Tennessee in the 2016 election, also signed an executive order after the speech to make it easier for the private sector to locate broadband infrastructure on federal land and buildings, part of a push to expand high-speed internet in rural America. Faster internet speeds in rural areas are often considered key to addressing the economic divide between rural and urban America, but the costs have so far been prohibitive. \nAbout 39 percent of rural Americans lack access to high- speed internet service, the Federal Communications Commission said in a 2016 report. \n\"We need to get rural America more connected. We need it for our tractors, we need it for our schools, we need it for our home-based businesses,\" a White House official told reporters ahead of Trump's speech. \nThe White House described the moves as an incremental step to help spur private development while the administration figures out how it can help with funding, something that could become part of Trump's plan to invest in infrastructure. \nThe CEO of the leading telecommunications trade group in the country, Jonathan Spalter, said USTelecom would push to ensure the government sets aside money for helping build and upgrade network infrastructure, as well as dismantling and streamlining regulations.

Steve Scalise (R-LA), speaks at a news conference following a closed House Republican conference meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., December 19, 2017. \nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday he seeks a deal with Democrats on protecting hundreds of thousands of young immigrants, but wants to see a \"good, balanced package\" that boosts border security. \n\"We want to have a DACA compromise,\" Ryan said, referring to the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. \"We want to make sure the DACA problem is solved. … This has to be balanced so we don't have a DACA problem five, 10 years down the road.\" \nRyan added that he wants \"the right kind of interior and border enforcement\" included in an immigration bill. His comments came shortly before bipartisan lawmakers were to meet with President Donald Trump to try to strike a deal. \nTrump has insisted on including funding to build his proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border in a deal , complicating the talks with Democrats, who do not want to use federal funds for the project. The Trump administration has estimated that the barrier would cost $18 billion over 10 years. \nMaking matters even messier is the administration's willingness to scale back funding for \"proven security measures\" such as surveillance, radars, patrol boats and customs agents in order to fund the wall, according to The New York Times . \nShielding those immigrants has emerged as a sticking point in negotiations to fund the government and avoid a shutdown by the Jan. 19 deadline. \nIn September, Trump ended the DACA program with a six-month delay to force congressional action to pass its protections into law. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children could face deportation if lawmakers do not pass a law shielding them by March 5. \nThe DACA program not only protected the immigrants from deportation but also allowed them to work in the United States.

Issa's district is one of the areas Steyer is targeting. \nDemocrats see numerous chances to pick up seats and potentially gain control of the House, partly driven by President Donald Trump 's low approval ratings.

Snap disclosed in its third-quarter earnings report that it had 178 million daily active users , which includes people who create content, look at content and use other features like Discover. \nHere are some of the Daily Beast's findings : Snapchat users spent an average of 34.5 minutes per day on the app in September. Though it was a slight decline from the previous month, the overall trend shows an increase in time spent. Snap had said in May that users spend over 30 minutes on the app. Compare that to Instagram, which said in August that younger users spend about 32 minutes per day on its app. Snapchat users sent about 34.1 messages per day in September. In mid-September, about 125 million people were creating snaps daily on the app, up from 120 million in late April. Most Snap stories get posted on the weekend, with peak activity on Saturday.

The North said its delegation would comprise athletes, high-ranking officials, a cheering squad, art performers as well as reporters and spectators. \nSouth Korea has unilaterally banned several North Korean officials from entry in response to Pyongyang's ramped-up missile and nuclear tests, held despite international pressure. \nHowever, some South Korean officials have said they see the Olympics as a possible opportunity for easing tension. \nForeign ministry spokesman Roh Kyu-deok said Seoul would consider whether it needed to take \"prior steps\", together with the U.N. Security Council and other relevant countries, to help the North Koreans visit for the Olympics. \nWorking talks will be held soon to work out the details of bringing the North Koreans to the Olympics, the statement said, with the exact schedule to be decided via documented exchanges. Family reunion \nAt Tuesday's talks, the first since December 2015, Seoul proposed inter-Korean military discussions to reduce tension on the peninsula and a reunion of family members in time for February's Lunar New Year holiday, but the joint statement made no mention of the reunions. \nThe North has finished technical work to restore a military hotline with South Korea, Seoul said, with normal communications set to resume on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear what information would be transferred along the hotline. \nThe North cut communications in February 2016, following the South's decision to shut down a jointly run industrial park in the North. \nNorth Korea also responded 'positively' to the South's proposal for athletes from both sides to march together at the Games' opening ceremony and other joint activities during the Winter Olympics, Seoul said. \nAthletes of the two sides have not paraded together at international sports events since the 2007 Asian Winter Games in China, after relations chilled under nearly a decade of conservative rule in the South. \nThe United States, which has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War, initially responded coolly to the idea of inter-Korean meetings, but U.S. President Donald Trump later called them \"a good thing.\" \nTrump has said he would like to see talks go beyond the Olympics. \"At the appropriate time, we'll get involved,\" he said. \nOn Tuesday, China's foreign ministry said it was happy to see talks between North and South Korea and welcomed all positive steps. Russia echoed the sentiment, with a Kremlin spokesman saying, \"This is exactly the kind of dialogue that we said was necessary.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T15:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T15:41:29.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

He reiterated that on Wednesday.\nSpeculation had centered on Abel and Jain as possible successors, and Buffett told CNBC that elevating them would have also made sense five years ago. He said he decided about six weeks ago to make the move, saying to himself, \"why not now.\"\nTo accommodate Abel and Jain in their new roles, Berkshire's board has voted to increase the number of directors from 12 to 14.\nIt was Munger's idea for Abel, Jain, and himself to all have vice chair titles, Buffett said.\nAbel joined Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company in 1992 and currently serves as its chairman and CEO.

The '70s classic runs on bio-diesel. \nAs Osborne notes, compared to your typical gas guzzler, that means the engine has fewer parts and a lower operating cost. \n\"You drive to your favorite Chinese restaurant. When you finish dinner, you ask them for the check and also for the oil that they fried your pork fried rice in, and then just put it in the car and you drive home,\" jokes Osborne. \nIn actuality, it's \"not quite that simple at all,\" says Leno. Bio-diesel is based in vegetable oil or animal fat, but it's often blended. 1989 Morgan Plus 8 \nThis traditional English sports car, which originally sold for $35,000 at a time when manufacturers were racing to meet emission standards, runs on propane. \n\"Propane burns more efficiently than gasoline does, so it actually provides a higher octane and better combustion, which gives you more performance,\" Osborne tells Leno. \"The problem is: The infrastructure for getting propane is not that for getting gasoline,\" because, though propane is more efficient, gas is cheaper. 1953 Paxton Phoenix \nOldest and perhaps most intriguing of the three, this high-end fiberglass luxury car is a personal favorite of Osborne. It's powered by steam. \nTo produce the car, 20th century entrepreneur Robert Paxton McCulloch consulted with Abner Doble, an engineer who designed over 40 unique car prototypes and who is a personal hero of Leno's. \n\"He produced the greatest steam car ever made: The only steam car where you turn a key and drive away,\" says Leno. \"I have two of them.\" \nThe Phoenix never made it to production, notes Osborne, because of hold ups at the steam power plant. Had it gotten to the market, it would have cost around $10,000 in the early 1950s, a time when the average car cost between $2,000 and $3,000. \nThis one appreciated over 100 percent in the past five years from a value of $175,000 to $375,000. According to Osborne, that's because of a recent rise in public interest interest in one-offs, prototypes and concept cars. \nWhat about the others? Have they appreciated more or less?

The S&P was up 13 percent in 1964, but the Nasdaq roared ahead 85 percent in 1999, before crashing shortly after.\nThe fact that the first five trading days of the year were positive was already a good omen. Detrick, senior market strategist, said when the first five days of a new year are up 2 percent or more, the full year has been higher 15 out of 15 times. The average gain in those years has been 18.6 percent.\n\"It sure seems like there's something to it,\" said Detrick. \"Even though it's a very small sample size it does suggest if you get the ball rolling it can very well continue. The fact it was such a strong start to the year just continues to reinforce the bull market is still alive and there's probably a lot more positives than negatives as we move out into 2018.\"\nDetrick said January looks to be sizing up to a positive month overall, and as the Wall Street saying goes, \"So goes January, so goes the year.\"\n\"Off to a good start and January is higher is just one more sign this could be a double-digit equity return year for investors,\" he said.\nBut a good January doesn't mean a good February, and Detrick said there could be a pullback in February, one of the weaker months, before the market moves higher in March and April, seasonally strong months.\nJulian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said it's possible there could be a pullback even before next month. On Tuesday he released his S&P 500 year-end target of 3,000. The S&P closed Tuesday at 2,741, up 0.1 percent but up nearly 3 percent for the year so far.\n\"If it happens, January is a likely time for it,\" he said. \"I think it could happen later this month as you get closer to the government funding deadline of the 19th and a little later the [Federal Open Market Committee].

The Fed is not expected to raise interest rates at that meeting.\nEmanuel said there was medium-term market volatility in past transitions of Fed chairs. \"[Ben] Bernanke took over in 2006. Obviously, the top came in 2007. [Alan] Greenspan on the other hand, took over in the summer of 1987, and literally you had the market crash within months of him taking over,\" he said.\nEmanuel said when Paul Volcker came in during the late 1970s, there was a massive surge in gold and interest rates.\nInterest rates could be a factor for markets Wednesday, after the 10-year broke 2.50 and hit a high of 2.55 percent Tuesday, its highest since March. The move in yields started with a move by the Bank of Japan to buy fewer bonds , which stirred speculation it was moving away from quantitative easing.\nBut strategists believe the move was more technical and the BOJ will continue its easy policies, at least for now.\nThe Treasury auctions $20 billion reopened 10-year notes at 1 p.m. ET Wednesday.\n\"I'm expecting average results.

As former Trump advisor Steve Bannon was being pushed out of his perch at Breitbart News following backlash over comments he made to journalist Michael Wolff about the president and his family, the White House announced that Trump would be going to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland – an event widely seen as the annual retreat of the globalist financial elite.\nWhat's more, the president invited cameras in to record nearly an hour of his negotiations with Democrats and Republicans on DACA , suggesting to them he was open to a comprehensive deal on immigration reform.\nAs for the wall Trump campaigned on, aides suggested quietly that it doesn't need to be all that long; just so there's enough built that the president can credibly say he kept his campaign promise.\n\"He was always more moderate than he was given credit for,\" an administration official told me Tuesday. \"On almost everything, with few exceptions, he is willing to deal.\"\n\"The main thing about the wall is you don't have to have a wall for all three thousand miles. You can have sections. It doesn't take that much.\"\nAll of that comes at a time when the president is being increasingly embraced by members of the the Republican establishment — even Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker , who once publicly doubted Trump's stability and competence, stood smiling behind the president Monday in Tennessee as he signed an order on rural broadband access, happily accepting the president's pen as a keepsake.\nThe moment certainly seems ripe for Trump to capture more legislative momentum.\nBut, once again, the details could get in the president's way. Look at the two legislative items the president has said he wants to push this year: Welfare reform and infrastructure.\nQuestions about infrastructure plans On infrastructure, the president's biggest problem will be House conservatives. The White House has already held conversations with the conservative Republican Study Committee and Freedom Caucus to persuade conservatives to support infrastructure spending that they might otherwise see as Obama-style government stimulus spending.\nPart of the pitch will be developing ways to say the infrastructure spending pays for itself, including by streamlining requirements for construction projects, and developing a dynamic score for the final package that takes into account expected economic growth.\nBut there's a lot still to be determined, including what the technical details will be, how much detail the White House wants to release, and how much the Trump team wants to leave up to the congressional committees to fill in the blanks.\nshow chapters Barney Frank: Tradeoff for tax cuts is there's no money left for infrastructure 9:21 AM ET Fri, 5 Jan 2018 | 02:56 \"I don't get the sense that we have had the kinds of serious conversations that it would take,\" said an administration official. \"The president's inclination is just 'spend money,' while the House is more talking about public private partnerships.\"\n\"The president's view of it is a Manhattan-centric vision of giant bridges and tunnels that people remember. If Donald Trump is building something, he wants it to be huge.\"\nA senior GOP Capitol Hill aide agreed that the plan under consideration and the president's plan might be at odds. \"There's an outline of a plan that (White House economic advisor) Gary Cohn has put forward. I'm not sure if Trump is completely on board with that,\" the aide said.\n\"I think the onus is on the administration and the White House in particular to come up with a plan to sell it to members. A giant spending bill might have some issues with conservatives.\"\nA tricky path to welfare reform As for welfare reform, White House officials say they see it as a natural follow up to tax reform: now that they have stimulated the economy, they want to push additional people back into the workforce.

The Trump administration has said it wants to raise that to 85 percent and wants 50 percent of that to come from the United States. That would raise costs for manufacturers. \nKansas City Southern owns railroad track in the U.S. and Mexico. It offers significant cross-border transportation services for companies. \nConstellation Brands is an international beer, wine and spirits company with operations in U.S., Mexico and Canada. It also imports beer brands such as Corona Extra and Modelo Especial. \nMexico and Canada-related ETFs also fell. The iShares MSCI Mexico ETF declined 2.2 percent, while the iShares MSCI Canada ETF dropped 1.1 percent. \nMexico and Canada together represent nearly one-third of total U.S. agricultural exports.

It is keeping the rest of the global business, which includes KitKat and Aero. \nFerrero, which also makes Ferrero Rocher pralines and Kinder chocolate eggs, is run by Giovanni Ferrero, whose grandfather founded the firm in 1946 in the small Italian town of Alba, in Piedmont. \nFor many years Ferrero relied on internal growth but began making acquisitions after Giovanni became the company's sole CEO in 2011 following the death of his brother.

This would help the chain reduce cash interest expenses and extend maturities.\nWhile reiterating his beliefs that Sears has the right strategy to turn itself around, Chief Executive Officer Eddie Lampert wrote in blog post that, should the refinancing \"not be fully successful, the Company's Board will consider all other options to maximize the value of Sears Holdings' assets.\"\nSears' shares climbed 3.5 percent Wednesday, after falling more than 12 percent in the opening trading days of 2018.\nSears has also raised $100 million in new financing and is pursuing an additional $200 million from other lenders, the company revealed Wednesday.\nSears has been in discussions about monetizing some of its own brands and assets, Lampert said. That could include diversifying Sears' revenue stream through its Home Services, Auto Services, Kenmore, and DieHard businesses, but these actions require \"a more stable environment and more cooperative partners,\" according to the CEO and hedge fund manager.\nJust last week, Sears announced another round of store closures, which the company said were some of its \"lowest performing\" locations. In turn, Sears has been piloting smaller concept stores that only showcase mattresses and appliances, and it recently started selling some of its brands (Kenmore and DieHard) through Amazon .\nTo be sure, none of this covers up the fact Sears had a dismal holiday season.

But Sears is still working to cut costs in 2018 and said it should be able to trim about $200 million in expenses, on an annualized basis, which would be unrelated to any store closures.\nManagement has also reaffirmed Sears is still pushing to return to profitability against a backdrop of vendor disputes and liquidation sales.\n\"As previously announced, we are actively pursuing transactions to adjust our capital structure in order to generate liquidity and increase our financial flexibility,\" Chief Financial Officer Rob Riecker said.\nSears said its latest $100 million in funding as well as the $200 million it's seeking would be supported by ground leases on its real estate assets and other \"select intellectual property.\"\nMoving forward, Lampert said Sears could \"materially improve the financial strength and operating focus of Sears Holdings and provide meaningful reassurance of our viability to our vendors and business partners.\" The CEO added that Sears has made progress in prefunding contributions to its pension plan for the next two years.\nThe department store chain recently struck a deal with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. over its pension obligations, clearing the way for the company to try to sell about 140 additional properties. In exchange, Sears said it would pay $407 million to the plan.\n\"While these actions have so far helped our Company survive the so-called 'Retail Apocalypse' ... we need to undertake further measures,\" Lampert said in a statement.\nAnalysts and investors remain skeptical Lampert's \"actions\" will work over the long term.\n\"Sears is taking additional steps to address its upcoming maturities in fiscal 2018 and improve its liquidity as its unencumbered asset base continues to decline and its business turnaround remains elusive,\" Moody's analyst Christina Boni wrote in a note to clients.\n\"Despite brighter sales in the department store sector this holiday season, Sears continued to significantly underperform with comparable store sales declining in the range of 16-17% for the November/December period,\" Boni said.\nWATCH: Sears announces more store closures show chapters Sears to close an additional 103 Kmart and Sears stores      4:56 PM ET Thu, 4 Jan 2018 | 01:21", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T14:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T14:56:48.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The company’s vice president of Global Coffee, Andrew Linnemann, recognised this. “We set the standard for a dark, boldly roasted coffee and in this case, we broke a few of our own rules by taking a lighter approach to espresso which created a bright taste with sweet citrus notes and a smooth body,” he said.

Those orders pushed Boeing's backlog at the end of 2017 to 5,864 commercial airplanes, an all-time high. The backlog of orders totals seven years' worth of production.\nBoeing's deliveries met the company's guidance of delivering 760-765 commercial airplanes for the year. The company says it also means a sixth straight year where Boeing will deliver more planes than its rival Airbus . The European aerospace company is expected to announce its year-end delivery and order numbers next week.\nDeliveries and orders for Boeing's single-aisle 737 jet — its most popular plane — continued to grow, as it rolls out its more fuel-efficient MAX models, whose customers include American Airlines and Southwest Airlines . Boeing logged net orders for 745 of its 737 jets last year, up 35 percent from 550 a year earlier.\nFading, however, is the Boeing 747, which U.S. airlines have retired from their fleets in recent months in favor of sleeker, more fuel-efficient models . Boeing said it had 12 unfilled orders for 747s, down from 28 a year earlier. While airlines are phasing it out of their fleets, it is still used to carry cargo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T18:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T18:15:46.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The service, called Broadcast, was created to reduce friction for restaurant operators as they adopt digital ordering. Digital ordering represents 53 percent of all delivery orders, up from 33 percent in 2013, according to NPD. Chris Goodney | Bloomberg | Getty Images The Yelp app on a mobile phone. \nLevelUp is making it easier for restaurants to connect with customers on the digital platforms they're already using. \nThe technology company said Tuesday it has created a new service for restaurants to upload menus and offer order and pay and rewards programs to customers on multiple digital platforms using only one form. \nDubbed \"Broadcast,\" the service acts as a middleman between the restaurants and sites like Facebook , Messenger, Yelp, Foursquare, Amazon Alexa, Chase Pay, Apple Pay and Android Pay . With Broadcast, restaurants won't have to create one-on-one relationships with every digital ordering company. Instead, their information is uploaded and formatted to suit the style of each platform. \n\"LevelUp Broadcast enables consumers to discover nearby restaurants, browse the menu, place an order, pay and collect rewards, all directly within the channels where they already live, work and play, and at the very moment when they are actively seeking lunch or dinner options,\" Seth Priebatsch, founder and CEO, LevelUp, said in a statement. \"And because customers spend up to 50 percent more on digital orders than on orders placed in-restaurant or by phone, restaurants that use Broadcast are not only capturing new guests, but also high ticket sales.\" \nWhen ordering digitally, customers have more time to consider their options, and restaurants are better able to upsell. Upselling is technique where a restaurant offers upgrades or add-ons to meals at a regular or discounted price in an attempt to ring up a higher sale. \nAccording to the most recent data available from NPD, digital ordering represents 53 percent of all delivery orders, up from 33 percent in 2013. \nBroadcast was created to reduce friction for restaurant operators as they adopt digital ordering. The service aims to help drive transactions, increase speed of service and bolster brand loyalty by targeting diners within the platforms that they are already using. \n\"At Mama Fu's, we are thrilled to be working with LevelUp as we build our digital presence and give guests new ordering options,\" Joshua Churnick, director of marketing at Mama Fu's, said in a statement. \"Having the added visibility on so many digital channels is a no-brainer for our customer acquisition strategy.\" \nAustin, Texas-based Mama Fu's operates a small chain of Asian fast-casual restaurants.

What the best do is take the necessary steps to thrive, rather than fold, when that moment finally arrives. Source: Graham Betchart Mental coach Graham Betchart \nSince receiving his masters in sports psychology from John F. Kennedy University in 2008, Betchart hashelped train countless athletes in mental toughness, including UFC fighters, NFL players and three recent NBA No. 1 draft picks — the Philadelphia 76ers' Ben Simmons, as well as the Minnesota Timberwolves' Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins. He's currently designing the mental training program for U.S.A. Basketball's youth program. \nHere are the three steps, he says, that Olympians take to perform in a pressure situation: 1. Get comfortable being uncomfortable \n\"You have to find a way to get into the moment, get into your body, trust your training,\" he says, \"even though literally everything is on the line and the entire world is watching.\" This is where the training comes in, because it takes years of preparation to stay calm in uncomfortable situations. Alain Grosclaude/Agence Zoom | Getty Images Lindsey Vonn of USA competes during the Alipine Ski World Cup Women's Super G on December 16, 2017 in France \n\"If you've never experienced feeling a little vulnerable or being uncomfortable, and you've always resisted that feeling... that's going to sabotage your performance,\" says Betchart. \nSo don't resist. \"Welcome it in,\" says Betchart. \"Then what you find is: What your afraid of is not as big a deal. What makes it a big deal resisting it.\" \nThe sports psychologist offers one anecdote from a personal experience. \"Before my wife gave birth, I'm not telling her everything's going to feel great,\" he says. Instead, he told her: \"You know the deal. This is a legendary uncomfortable moment. But if you embrace it, that takes away the panic, the anxiety and the fear. You're still going to be uncomfortable, but you don't have the anxiety. And that allows you to perform.\" 2. Reframe your feelings \nBeing okay with a discomfort is one thing, but, to take this a step further and truly thrive under pressure, you need to reframe what you are feeling in a positive light. \"Reframing is everything,\" says Betchart. \n\"The really good basketball players have told themselves it's not nervousness [that they're feeling]. They've told themselves it's excitement and joy.\" show chapters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T18:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T18:15:47.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Tesla is no different, striking a deal last year to build a factory there. \n\"I think it's the right step for them, it would reduce their manufacturing and delivery cost,\" Hsieh said when asked if he felt Tesla would become a threat. \"We think that it will be a very competitive market and they need to be here as it's the largest car market in the world. And while it is a threat to us, we think we are more than up to the challenge.\" \nNio has told investors that it is targeting sales between 20,000 to 30,000 units within 9 months of 2018. So far, the start-up looks to be on track: Hsieh said Nio has already sold out of its first batch of 10,000 orders for the ES8 all-electric sport utility vehicle , which was only launched on Dec. 16. The local advantage \nNio enjoys an advantage over Tesla due to government support. Hsieh said Tesla has been seeking subsidies or tariff reliefs from China, but he predicted the company will not qualify. \nNio is subsidized approximately $48,000 Chinese yuan ($7,380) per car from the Chinese government, with additional cuts on a localized city-by-city basis. Johannes Eisele | AFP | Getty Images Tesla car dealership in Shanghai taken on March 17, 2015. \nWhen asked about the profitability of his company's vehicles, Hsieh said: \"On a gross margin basis, our vehicles will be profitable.\" \n\"Out of the box, they will be profitable. We will not sell the vehicles for less than we make it for,\" he added. \nThat said, he was also pragmatic in his assessment, noting that it will take Nio several more years to become profitable on a profit and loss basis. \nNio's ES8 is currently retailing for half the price of the Tesla model X. The competition heats up \nMajor manufacturers and established foreign car makers such as GM , Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes are also eyeing the electric car market in China. \nHsieh said those companies could eventually become competitors to Nio, but the threat is currently only theoretical. \n\"Yes, they will be ... but you could ask me this in 2019 or 2020 because we are not here yet,\" he said. \"Everyone is announcing cars but no one has delivered a car except for Tesla and now, hopefully us in the next couple months.\" \nAnother Chinese start-up, Byton, has recently announced its entry into the market. Hsieh expressed less optimism about that company's target, predicting its goal of releasing an electric car by 2019 will be delayed. What does the future hold for Nio? \nHsieh also offered a glimpse into the company's future, highlighting plans for entry into the U.S. market in 2020. \n\"It will probably be our third car ... we plan to release one car every year,\" he said, adding that this would take place on a designated \"Nio Day\" every December. \nWhile there have been talks about an eventual U.S. initial public offering , Hsieh declined to comment to CNBC on the matter.

Bush did when he raised taxes despite his \"read my lips\" promise. And we all know what that did to Bush's re-election hopes.\nThis all became clear during Tuesday's fully televised immigration and budget meeting at the White House between President Trump and a large bipartisan congressional crowd.\nBefore that meeting, President Trump had been taking a hard line on the issue of the children of illegal immigrants or \"Dreamers.\" The president had been insisting that unless the Democrats agreed to more funding for border security and the building of his famous \"wall,\" there would be no deal on the Dreamers and the DACA policy that protects them from deportation.\nBut then in front of all those Democrats and the TV cameras, President Trump made the following statement:\n\" I will say, when this group comes back -- hopefully with an agreement -- this group and others from the Senate, from the House, comes back with an agreement, I'm signing it.\"\nThat didn't sound like a man who won't accept any immigration deals without the wall. It sounded like a politician who's ready to go along to get along. Those are the kind of politicians who lose their base and lose elections.\nPresident Trump's performance seemed to be part of a larger shift to the middle. It came on the heels of the total break with anti-illegal immigration firebrand Steve Bannon and the announcement that President Trump would be attending the globalist World Economic Forum at Davos later this month.\nConservatives and anti-illegal immigration leaders exploded. People like Ann Coulter laid into the president . Bannon's now former online news site Breitbart News featured several articles and interviews predicting a Trump surrender on immigration . Leading conservative radio host Mark Levin urged President Trump to \"come back\" from that statement. FOX News anchor Tucker Carlson used his program to ask: \"What was the point of running for president?\"\nSince he made that statement at Tuesday's meeting, President Trump has posted multiple tweets about immigration including one that said he remains committed to border security:\nTrump tweet\nBut President Trump is still has a lot of work to do to avoid a situation where a significant portion of his base feels betrayed.\nTo protect himself politically, President Trump has two jobs to do. First, he must stand firm on getting that added border wall and security money. Anything less will be a total disaster in the eyes of a critical mass of his supporters.\nSecond, he needs to convince his base that agreeing not to deport the Dreamers is a justifiable move and won't mean amnesty for others. He could potentially get help on that part of the job from scores of Republican politicians and former politicians like President George W. Bush, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Senator Jeff Flake, and others from the GOP who have long advocated this kind of immigration reform.\nJeb Bush has already tweeted his support for President's comments. But since almost all of the other Republicans have either attacked or been attacked by President Trump over the last two years, their support is not guaranteed.\nStill, this nuance presents President Trump with a lot more wiggle room than President George H.W. Bush had back in 1990. Bush's choice was to either give in to a tax hike or not. Bush made the wrong choice.\nPresident Trump can claim a reasonable degree of victory if he gets that border funding. It will be even better for him if that funding leads to some kind of tangible evidence like at least a partially-constructed wall by the end of this year.\nThere's one other possible escape hatch that could save him with the more extreme members of his base. That would happen if the Democrats refuse to give in on border funding and follow through with threats to shut down the government. That would make President Trump look like an anti-illegal immigration stalwart.\nThe Democrats would then be forced to explain why they were willing to shut down the government even though President Trump was willing to compromise on DACA. It remains to be seen if the Democrats would so foolishly snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.\nBut President Trump cannot politically survive any rubber stamping of a DACA deal that passes Congress and doesn't include immediately boosted border security money. If he does, he will be punished permanently at the polls and the rest of the establishment GOP will go down with him.\nCommentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist.

Up to Tuesday’s close, they have gained nearly 12 percent since its last quarterly results on Oct. 17. \nTo counter a slowdown in its legacy hardware and software businesses, IBM has been shifting focus steadily towards data analytics and cloud computing services. \nThe cloud market is currently dominated by Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure unit - both of which have been growing in double digits as customers scale up their Internet presence. \n“There is room for another cloud player,” Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz wrote in a note titled “IBM - A New Dawn Emerges” and raised his price target on the stock to $192 from $133. \nThe company, which will report after U.S. markets close on Thursday, trumped Wall Street’s estimates for both profit and revenue in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. \nWhile total revenue in that quarter fell 0.4 percent, the 22nd straight quarterly fall, it was also the smallest quarterly drop since the third quarter of 2016. \nMoskowitz said IBM’s revenue may prove stable or even grow over the next 12-18 months. \nHe also argued that recently disclosed Spectre and Meltdown processor security flaws could allow IBM to gain share in the mid-range and high-end server market. \nIBM last month launched Power9 processors, designed for cloud computing and machine learning, to better compete with the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. \nA fix for Meltdown, which only affects Intel chips, could lower performance by 30 percent in some cases, pushing customers to look for new processors, potentially lifting both IBM’s market share and revenue, Moskowitz wrote. \nIn a blog post dated Jan. 15, IBM said firmware patches for Power9 platforms were available to fix the security flaws.

The consumer wants value. The consumer wants reliability. And the consumer will pay for it,\" the \" Mad Money \" host said. \"It almost feels like you can throw darts at the stocks of the consumer companies ... and end up with a winner.\"\nAs institutional investors and money managers chase industrial stocks for gains, Cramer found it worth turning his focus to the consumer cohort. Here are the six tailwinds he sees:\n1. Holidays For years, much of retail was bogged down by \"promotional activity,\" an industry phrase that means issuing deep discounts on items to get rid of inventory.\nBut after a robust holiday season where many retailers focused on tightening their inventories while still offering deals, Cramer said the outlook has improved — though not without a caveat.\n\"As much as I'd like to praise the companies themselves for getting it right, and they deserve it, it's almost like they'd have to go out of their way to get it wrong with this newfound, more positive consumer mindset,\" he said.\n2. Trump Some might scoff, but even Cramer couldn't deny that President Donald Trump's policies have benefited business.\nWhile Trump can't take credit for the broader global economic expansion or the fact that the economy was already improving when he took office, his deregulation efforts have moved the needle, Cramer said.\n\"Corporations don't fear expanding as much as they used to because they know we now have a much more benign regulatory environment, and I bet that's what the banks will say when they start reporting on Friday ,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"I'm not really a believer in trickle-down economics, but some of that trickles down to the consumer.\"\n3. Taxes Nearly every company Cramer has touched base with has cash on the sidelines. Because most consumer-facing companies are high domestic taxpayers, the \"Mad Money\" host expected corporate tax cuts to reflect nicely on their balance sheets.\n\"Their budgets for buybacks and dividends were all based on the old tax code, so those dividends and buybacks are about to get bigger ,\" he said.\n4. Jobs Even without meaningful wage inflation, job creation is inspiring confidence — and spending — among consumers, Cramer said. \n\"Those hundred companies offering bonuses certainly don't hurt, especially because I expect many more to do so,\" he added.\n5. E-commerce Companies are finally starting to mobilize, digitize and push back against e-commerce giants like Amazon , improving their customer experiences and sparking buy-online-pick-up-in-store initiatives, Cramer said.\n\"They got wise,\" he said. \"They're competing on a more level playing field, meaning Amazon is no longer the retail Death Star .\"\n6. Value Last but not least, consumers are increasingly seeking value, which is as present in a $1,000 Canada Goose jacket as it is in a $4 meal from Denny's, Cramer said.\nWhat matters to consumers now is quality and service, meaning chains that focus on these aspects — like Kohl's, according to its CEO — are poised to succeed, the \"Mad Money\" host said.\nFinal Thoughts As many areas of the market surge or bounce back, Cramer asked investors to keep an eye on the hidden winners.\n\"Here's the bottom line, at least from the ICR conference as I see it: don't get in front of the consumer freight train,\" Cramer said. \"It's coming full speed ahead, and it's better to get on the locomotive than get run over by one.\"\nWATCH: Cramer on the state of the consumer-facing market show chapters Cramer lists 6 tailwinds for consumer-related stocks      21 Hours Ago | 10:28 Questions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

Josh Gottheimer told CNBC he has a solution for high-tax states that will be hurt by the new cap on state and local deductions. The idea is for local governments to establish funds that pay for local services and taxpayers who make voluntary contributions to get a tax credit. He believes it will stand up to legal scrutiny. 5 Hours Ago | 05:36 \nNew Jersey Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer told CNBC that he has a solution for high-tax states that will be hurt by the new cap on state and local (SALT) deductions — and he believes it will stand up to legal scrutiny. \nThe overhaul of the nation's tax code, signed into law late last year by President Donald Trump , limits the amount of SALT deductions to $10,000. Previously, there was no limit. New Jersey has some of the highest property taxes in the country. \n\"People would be able to give a charitable contribution to their towns, their municipalities and the towns can give a tax credit on people's property tax bills,\" Gottheimer said in an interview with \" Power Lunch .\" \nGottheimer recently unveiled the proposal, along with New Jersey Gov.-elect Phil Murphy, Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., and several local mayors. \nThe idea is for local governments to establish or support funds that pay for local services like roads, bridges and police officers. Taxpayers can make voluntary contributions, for which they will get a tax credit. \nGottheimer believes the IRS code allows for such a move. In fact, 22 states already do a version of this and eight law professors just came out in support of the proposal, he said. \n\"The IRS has ruled on this, the municipality is allowed to give a tax credit for contributing to them,\" Gottheimer said. \nAn IRS spokesperson told CNBC it is the agency's policy to correspond directly with members of Congress regarding legislation and had no further comment. \nHowever, Gottheimer conceded that more needs to be done to ease the tax burden, including getting expenditures under control. \n\"We've got to cut taxes. But why not claw back the dollars? We just faced a tax hike. I'm for looking for every single way to actually get those dollars back and cut our taxes.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T23:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T00:10:19.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Democrats need Sanders to do more than rant. And he needs to more than that as well, if he wants a legitimate political future.\nWith passage of the tax reform bill, Republicans have proved they are a real threat, and Democrats can see verbal attacks alone aren't going to stop the Trump/GOP legislative agenda. But unlike the tax bill, the current budget and immigration issues will require at least some Democratic votes to resolve, handing them a golden opportunity.\nIf there ever was time for Bernie to get involved and push for some real compromise, this is it.\nBut so far, he's still all talk. Sanders was a no-show at that big publicly televised meeting at the White House Tuesday on the budget and immigration issues.\n\"The Democrat establishment may still be angry with Sanders for whatever real or imagined damage he may have done to Hillary Clinton's campaign. But it's past time for Sanders to push his way into the center of the game.\" It must be disappointing for all those \"Berniac\" fans who supported him for president against all odds in 2016. More than a year later he's still polling as America's most popular politician.\nBut Sanders doesn't seem the least bit interested in getting into actual governing. In fact, he still isn't even officially a member of the Democratic Party.\nJust take a minute to consider that for a second. The man who earned the fifth most total presidential primary votes in U.S. history isn't even a member of the party whose nomination he was seeking in 2016.\nThat doesn't mean Sanders isn't a frequent critic of President Donald Trump when he appears on TV. And his Twitter feed and official Senate website are chock full of positions and biting comments.\nBut America is filled with people verbally attacking President Trump and making political statements. It's become a national cottage industry. There are only a few people who actually have the power to make policy or at least forge political compromises in Washington.\nThere are even fewer people who have shown an ability to attract previously apathetic or disillusioned Americans and encourage them to vote and even work for a campaign.\nSanders is one of those people. Yet he's been sitting on the sidelines since the 2016 election ended. The one official job the Democrats have given him is \"chairman of outreach,\" a newly created post designed to engage working class and young voters. Sanders hasn't publicly asked for anything more.\nSanders did craft a bill calling for the federal government to negotiate prescription drug prices for the entire country like it currently does for Medicare. But the bill went nowhere and there's no evidence that Sanders made any effort to negotiate the plan with the White House.\nHe has another bill to provide single-payer style health coverage for all Americans that has more than a dozen Democrat co-signers, but that bill isn't going anywhere.\nProposing bills that have no chance of passing in a majority Republican Congress isn't the best way Bernie can use whatever political capital he earned from the election.\nPerhaps we shouldn't be surprised. Sanders has been in Congress since 1991, but has barely had a legislative impact in Washington during that 27 year period. Other than going through the grueling effort of running for president, it's a fair argument to say that Bernie remains a lot more bark than bite.\nMaybe he has renewed reasons not to get more involved like his advancing age; he is 76 after all. There's also a potential headache brewing at home, as wife Jane Sanders may be the focus of a federal probe into her role in Burlington College's financial collapse and closure.\nMrs. Sanders was president of the school when it took out major loans to fund an expansion and could not pay off those loans. Investigators are looking into if the college deliberately gave the bank false financial data in the loan application process.\nBut whatever his reasons, the Democrats need him to change his mind and get more involved. That's because the party and the left in general don't have any other clear leaders at the moment.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's unfavorable ratings are very high . Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's \"unfavorables\" outweigh his approval numbers by almost 12 percentage points . Supposed up-and-comer Democrats like Senators Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Corey Booker are still relative unknowns.\nThe Democrat establishment may still be angry with Sanders for whatever real or imagined damage he may have done to Hillary Clinton's campaign. But it's past time for Sanders to push his way into the center of the game.\nIt's not about introducing bills, but taking a lead negotiating role on these budget and immigration issues. In his latest op-ed he's demanding no increased military spending, no end to DACA protections for \"Dreamers,\" no new tax breaks for billionaires, and better protections for Social Security and Medicare.\nThose are more like demands than opening offers, but perhaps Sanders is willing to trade one of those goals for concessions elsewhere. That's where years of just shouting and insulting the opposition have to end and leadership begins.\nReal political leaders have to make compromises. That stinks sometimes, but otherwise nothing gets done. What will Bernie choose?\nWith the 2016 election now 14 months in the past, it sure looks like Sanders is choosing to just keep talking. At some point, he may realize that making deals is the better choice if he wants to carve out a real legacy for himself.\nOtherwise, Bernie Sanders will more likely be remembered for being the guy with the Brooklyn accent and messy hair who almost beat Hillary Clinton, but otherwise made no lasting impact.\nCommentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist.

Even through the U.S. market remains lucrative, avocado marketers in the Mexican state of Jalisco recently hosted a Chinese delegation in hopes of grabbing a piece of the action that now is dominated by the neighboring state of Michoacan.\n\"The Chinese market has been growing at a very fast pace,\" said Ramon Paz, an advisor for the Avocado Producers and Exporting Packers Association of Mexico (APEAM). \"Our numbers show big growth but the total absolute numbers are still modest compared to other markets like the U.S. But of course the potential is huge.\"\nAccording to Chicago-based researcher Technomic, \"Avocado has evolved into a trending ingredient worldwide and has particular resonance in China — where it's commonly known as butter fruit — due to its somewhat exotic positioning.\"\nMost of the demand in China is from \"urban consumers\" in the largest cities of Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou, said Paz. He said Chinese millennials who have traveled overseas also are helping to grow the market.\nStill, Paz said the U.S. market remains a priority market for Mexican shippers for several reasons, including shorter transportation time, reduced risks and generally more favorable payment arrangements too. That said, he also indicated that demand for avocados also is strong in Japan and parts of Europe.\nMexico plans to ship 1.8 billion pounds of avocados to the U.S. in the current 2017-18 season, which runs from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018, according to Paz. By comparison, Latin American countries as a group shipped about 76 million pounds of avocados last season to China.\nEven so, there's a risk that with all the Latin American avocados going to China it could one day increase the cost to American consumers. Mexican-grown avocados account for almost 80 percent of the creamy fruit sold in the U.S. market.\n\"It could affect it, yes, because it's pulling product out of Chile, Peru or Mexico that would would be available to ship here,\" said Barnard. And he added, \"The Chinese pay pretty good — you get a premium.\"\nThe wholesale prices of avocado in the United States more than doubled last fall due to supply hiccups in Mexico. Supplies from Mexico ended up about 20 percent below the average last season and California's harvest was about half its usual amount, according to Paz.\n\"When you see 20 percent less, it has an impact in the market,\" said Paz. \"We had a short crop basically because avocados have a tendency to produce more one year and less the next year. This year the Mexican crop is back to normal and California is forecasting a regular crop, although they had some problems with the recent wildfires.\"\nDespite last year's higher prices, demand didn't fall off as Americans appear to be willing to pay more for their avocado and guacamole. Paz estimates avocado demand in the U.S. is growing about 10 to 12 percent per year.\nExecutives say there's also demand for avocados coming from other parts of Asia as well as Europe along with countries such as Argentina, which in the past two years has increased exports by around 50 percent from Chile.\n\"Between the nutrition and the health benefits and the versatility of use, avocados is obviously one of the fastest-growing produce items in the world as far as consumption,\" said Barnard.\nMission, which is privately held, grows, packs and ships avocados all over the world and has production operations in Chile, Peru, Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala and the United States.\nSaid Barnard, \"As someone right in the middle of it, we're continuing to increase supply because we don't see this thing slowing down any.\"\nBarnard believes the retail prices of avocados in the U.S. will average \"significantly lower\" in 2018 compared with 2017. \"If you get it down to around a dollar apiece for a medium-sized fruit, the stuff will fly off the shelves.\"\nPer capita consumption in the U.S. of avocados is around 7 pounds per person, up from 4 pounds in 2010, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. And produce executives say China is just a fraction of that amount today but if it approached the American levels it would be about 10 times the amount of fruit produced in the world.\nSource: Mission Produce Display of the avocados at a fruit store in China. Meantime, more avocados entering the Chinese market this year will get sent to ripening rooms in large distribution centers to allow the green fruit to become ready-to-eat. A drawback before the ripening rooms was Chinese consumers having to wait for the fruit to ripen before consuming it.\n\"The ripe fruit is growing much faster than unripe fruit, for obvious reasons — same as it does here,\" said Barnard. \"We put a ripening distribution center over there last March, and we're already adding a second one.\"\nMission Produce sends full containers of avocados packed either in Mexico, Chile or Peru to China and then refrigerates it. \"Upon demand, we'll ripen it and ship it out to the customers,\" said Barnard.\nThe ripening process for avocados is similar to bananas shipped green from Latin America that are then put into special ripening rooms to make them ideal for eating. Nature's ripening process is stimulated by using ethylene, which is a natural gas, along with ideal heat, humidity and airflow.\nMission first started selling into the Chinese market about four years ago and has two local partners for its ripe avocado brand, Mr. Avocado, in the Asian country. The U.S. company's joint venture partners include Chinese importer Lantao and a local retailer Pagoda, operator of 2,500 fruit-shop outlets.\n\"I have been in those fruit shops and you see a little bit of everybody buying,\" said Barnard. \"You see mothers and college kids. They eat pretty healthy over there — a lot of vegetables. And the fruit just adds another variable to the diet.\"\nThe Mr. Avocado brand has been using social media advertising in China to spread awareness of avocados and their health benefits. They also are doing suggestions on how to eat the fruit.\nInterestingly, the Chinese also have some avocados grown within their borders in regions such as Guangxi, located north of Vietnam. There also have been state-run farms doing trial plantings over the decades, even before significant demand existed in the domestic market.\n\"They have some trials in the south,\" said Barnard. \"We're monitoring it.\"\nHe said the Chinese \"have a big learning curve to go over\" to launch large-scale avocado production and also would face logistical challenges since production is \"in the middle of nowhere.\"\nThe avocado plant found in China is largely a tropical variety and similar to th", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T21:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T23:12:37.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Published 1 Hour Ago Andrey Rudakov | Bloomberg | Getty Images Pedestrians walk across Red Square past St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow. \nDemocratic U.S. lawmakers called on President Donald Trump's administration on Wednesday to treat foreign election interference as a national crisis, setting up a single agency to coordinate the response and establishing a new class of sanctions to quickly punish those responsible. \nDemocrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee released a report on Wednesday detailing what they described as nearly two decades of Russian efforts to influence elections elsewhere in Europe, and criticizing Trump for doing too little to address the issue. \nSenator Ben Cardin , the committee's ranking Democrat, commissioned the report after Trump's surprise November 2016 election victory. The report was released a year after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered in the campaign to benefit Trump, the Republican candidate, and undermine Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. \nMoscow has denied any such effort. Trump dismisses such assertions as sour grapes about his victory. \nThe document consists of eight chapters and several appendices detailing tools the Senate investigators said Russia used to influence elections in Europe and making more than 30 recommendations for how to prevent further interference in elections in Europe, the United States and other countries. \nThe investigators accused Moscow of trying to undermine democracies by spreading malicious disinformation, threatening countries' energy security and using \"cybercriminals\" to steal information. \n\"President Trump must be clear-eyed about the Russian threat, take action to strengthen our government's response and our institutions, and ... work with an international coalition to counter the threat and assert our values,\" Cardin said in a statement. \nThe report's recommendations included working to build democratic institutions in countries most vulnerable to election interference, and set up an organization similar to the National Counterterrorism Center to coordinate the U.S. reaction to such meddling. \nThey also called on Washington, and its allies, to freeze \"dirty\" Kremlin money and release publicly any intelligence on Russian President Vladimir Putin's assets stored abroad. \n\"The Russian government's use of corruption and money laundering also merit additional examination by relevant committees in Congress, as well as the Executive Branch,\" the report said. \nIt called on Washington to specially designate any country that seeks to influence others as a \"State Hybrid Threat Actors,\" subjected to preemptive sanctions, and called on social media companies to do comprehensive audits on how their platforms might have been used to influence elections. \nThe report's release coincides with deepening rifts between Republicans, who control Congress, and Democrats over congressional investigations into Russia and the election.

But that's exactly what 29-year-old Ryan Grant is doing . \nOnly four years after quitting his accounting job in Minneapolis to flip purchases full-time, his business has made over seven figures in lifetime profits, which have been heavily reinvested in the company. \n\"Pretty early on I realized I wasn't in the career path that I wanted to be on,\" he tells CNBC Make It . \"That experience really had me looking for other options and I was starting to explore ways that I could basically leave that job and have my own schedule and be on my own time.\" \nTo do that, Grant turned to the side hustle he had used to made ends meet in college. But an early mistake made him realize that, to make big money, he'd have to get smarter with what, and how, he was selling. Ryan Grant Ryan Grant spent 30 hours a week searching Walmart and other local retailers for products that he could flip on Amazon. \nAs a student at Winona State University, he organized textbook buyback events on campus twice a year. He listed the books on Amazon and shipped them out to customers around the country for a profit of up to $10,000 a year. \n\"Going through that process for one semester was enough to know that I didn't want to do it again,\" he says. \"From there forward I did Fulfillment by Amazon the rest of the way.\" \nUsing Amazon's fulfillment services meant he could ship all the books in bulk using preferred UPS rates to an Amazon warehouse, where, for a fee, the online retailer handled processing and shipping out each individual order. And, when Grant grew more unfulfilled at his accounting job, it sparked the idea of going online to flip more than just textbooks. Ryan Grant Grant scans items using InventoryLab's Scoutify 2 app (left) which reveals detailed sales data for a given product on Amazon. \nAfter work and on the weekends, he scoped out the clearance aisles at Walmart, scanned a few items using Amazon's app and bought up toys, games, and home improvement items he realized he could re-sell for a profit. A receipt from his early days shows a variety of purchases, everything from vacuums to Barbies, LEGO sets to stainless steel flatware. \n\"I was putting in about 10 hours per week and I was making in the ballpark of $1,000 per month,\" he recalls. Once he was able to make the same kind of money reselling on Amazon as he had made at his accounting job, in September 2013, he quit. \nProfits swelled to $9,000 a month just three months later and continued to grow for the following year and a half until a fateful purchasing decision landed Grant in trouble in 2015. Ryan Grant Coming across a product worth flipping on Amazon meant buying out the store. \nHe bought 750 units of a nail filing tool for dogs called \" Peticure Power \" in a liquidation sale and sent them to Amazon. When some customers started returning products they ran into issues with, the higher return rate flagged his account and resulted in a two-day suspension. \n\"I was stuck with probably around $2,000 of dead inventory,\" Grant recalls, adding that he lost an additional $6,000 in potential profit during the suspension. \"That was probably the biggest mistake that I made. ... From there on, I always made sure that any supplier that I'm buying from, the goods are 100 percent legitimate and I can get the invoices to prove it.\" \nEventually he got better at targeting more reputable items that represented the best opportunity for arbitrage. Seasonality, Grant realized, was a key factor. He could, for example, buy up discounted candy after Halloween and half-priced Christmas decorations around the New Year. Ryan Grant When Ryan Grant's kitchen was overflowing with boxes he was shipping to Amazon, he made the call to rent a warehouse. \n\"Believe it or not, there's actually people buying those items out of season,\" Grant laughs. \nStill, even he was surprised at how quickly the business took off. \"I went from just me in this business doing around $3-5,000 in sales per month and now, four years later, we're a team of 11 and we're doing well over $200,000 in sales per month,\" Grant says. The team had to move to a warehouse that's over five times as large as their first this past July. \nSince he started selling on Amazon, Grant says the business has topped $9 million in total sales. Profits are heavily reinvested back into the company, though Grant was still able to take a salary of around $150,000 when he was working on the venture full time. Ryan Grant After outgrowing his first warehouse, Grant's business expanded to a 3,800-square-foot office. \nAs his business is increasingly run by his team, Grant has reduced his salary down to $60,000 a year and now dedicates much of his time to teaching the ways of e-commerce. He consults and teaches classes through the same blog he has been using to track his performance. His hope is that he might be able to help a few people who might not be happy at their jobs find the same independence he did, and avoid the same mistakes he made early on. \n\"I was just looking to have freedom of schedule and replace the income that I had from that job and now it's turned into a lot more than that,\" he says. \"I mean, I would be sitting in an office cubicle now or working at a client location as opposed to doing what I want to do effectively when I want to do it.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T18:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T18:55:06.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Bullishness is at 64.4 percent while bearishness is down to 13.5 percent. However, the market has done quite well during the current run of elevated optimism, with the S&P 500 up 7 percent over the past 14 weeks. 5 Hours Ago | 03:15 \nMarket optimism may be reaching a crescendo, with hopes that stocks will keep rising equaling a level not seen in 31 years. \nSpecifically, the difference between bullishness and bearishness among professional investors is at its highest since April 1986, according to the Investors Intelligence survey that gauges the outlook of newsletter authors. \nThose expecting the market to move higher numbered 64.4 percent, up from 61.9 percent a week ago, according to an II release Wednesday. That's equal to the reading of early November 2017. On the other side, those looking for the market to fall tumbled to 13.5 percent, which is the lowest level since August 2014. \nThe spread between the two numbers is 50.9 percent, up from 46.7 percent a week ago. That multidecade high normally would represent a contrarian signal that the market is getting into dangerously overbought levels. \nHowever, the time period when the spread was last this high inspires a particular reason for caution. Sentiment surveys can be contrarian indicators when they reach elevated levels, meaning that rampant bullishness is often a sell signal. \nBulls and bears showed a wide disparity in 1986, with optimism occasionally wavering then rebounding. That movement, of course, would yield brutal results a year and a half later when Black Monday hit the stock market and the Dow fell nearly 22 percent in one wicked October day.

The S&P 500 is up about 7 percent during that period. \nThis particular bull market, which is nearing its ninth anniversary, has featured low participation from retail investors, and thus could have more staying power as the mom and pop crowd gets more optimistic. \n\"There has been a marked shift in momentum the last couple of months, from years of rampant pessimism and skepticism, to now questions that have a much more of an optimistic and opportunistic tune to them,\" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. \nElevated levels of sentiment are \"a concern, but in and of itself is not a reason to throw in the towel and get out,\" Sonders said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T20:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T20:27:39.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Here's how it works: \n— You are bullish the underlying asset. \n— Gives you the right, but not the obligation, to buy a stock at a set price for a given period of time. \n— Defines one's risk against potential volatility. \n\"There aren't too many risk assets where you could [see the asset double], and that's what we've been talking about with [cryptocurrencies],\" he said. \"But when you're buying calls, short-dated calls, for instance, into events, you have the potential to do that.\" \nAs an example of a speculative event where a stock could see wild swings, Nathan brings up Bank of America earnings. The big bank is set to report next Wednesday before the bell, and he used the stock to show how buying a call can help investors hedge their bets heading into a volatile event like earnings. \nNathan suggested buying the January 30.5-strike calls for 50 cents. This trade makes money if Bank of America rises above $31 by next Friday's expiration. \nBut the trader also has the potential to make much more than that. \n\"To get a double you need [Bank of America to close at $31.50], that's up about 3.5 percent,\" he said. \"For me, that's taking a speculative view on a short-term event, being long premium and defining your risk.\" \nOn Wednesday, Bank of America rallied more than 1 percent and was trading around $30.70, just 30 cents below the break-even point for Nathan's trade.

It remains to be seen whether the company will lose its lustre without the Oracle of Omaha. \nBuffett named Gregory Abel, 55, and Ajit Jain, 66, to the company's board on Wednesday. Abel will serve as vice chairman of non-insurance business, while Jain will serve as vice chair of insurance operations. \nThe appointments are \"part of a movement to succession over time,\" Buffett told CNBC in an exclusive interview . \nThe legendary investor's departure would put the company into unchartered territory for retail investors.

U.S. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, who attended the gathering, told reporters on Friday that Trump used “vile, vulgar” language, including repeatedly using the word “shithole” when speaking about African countries. \nThe Republican president’s comments were decried as racist by African and Haitian politicians, by the United Nations human rights office and by U.S. lawmakers from both major parties. \nTrump, who has been accused of racism over several issues since he took office a year ago, sought to walk back the comments on Friday, saying on Twitter, “The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used.” \nTrump also denied saying “anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country.” \nAccording to two sources, at Thursday’s meeting Trump questioned why the United States would want to accept immigrants from Haiti and African nations, referring to some as “shithole countries.” \nWhile many Republican lawmakers stayed quiet on Trump’s remarks, Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, called them “unfortunate” and “unhelpful,” noting in an interview on CNN that his family had emigrated to the United States from Ireland to help build the nation’s railroads. \nAt an event on Friday at the White House, Trump honored the memory of Martin Luther King Jr, the civil-rights era activist who was slain in 1968. King’s memory is marked with a national holiday, which falls this year on Monday. \nTrump stood beside Isaac Newton Farris, King’s nephew, while a group of about 20 African-American supporters and members of his administration were on hand in the Roosevelt Room, including Ben Carson, his Housing and Urban Development secretary. He ignored reporters who shouted questions about his remarks. \nA group of Republican and Democratic senators has been working for months to craft legislation that would protect 700,000 young adults who were brought into the country illegally as children and later shielded from deportation under a program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. \nIn a series of tweets on Friday, Trump also suggested that momentum toward a deal on maintaining such protection had stalled. “The so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards,” he said. \nFILE PHOTO - U.S. President Donald Trump addresses a joint news conference with Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg in the East Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., January 10, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst The tentative deal also addresses border security, including a border wall, the diversity visa lottery and chain migration, in which U.S. green-card holders can sponsor other family members for permanent residence in the country. \nAmong other objections, Trump said the plan did not provide proper funding for the proposed wall that he made a center-piece of his election campaign. He added the country “would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime countries which are doing badly.” \n‘SHOCKING AND SHAMEFUL’ \nHaiti said it was shocked by Trump’s reported remarks on Thursday and summoned the top U.S. diplomat in the country, asking for an apology if the vulgar term had been used. \nEl Salvador’s government sent the U.S. a formal letter of protest that said the president had “implicitly” accepted the use of “harsh terms detrimental to the dignity of El Salvador and other countries.” \nBotswana also said it had summoned the U.S. ambassador to that country to “express its displeasure” and had asked him whether Botswana “is regarded as a ‘shithole’ country.” \nTrump’s comments are extremely offensive to South Africa, said Jessie Duarte, a senior official with the ruling African National Congress. “Ours is not a shithole country. Neither is Haiti or any other country in distress,” she said. \nIn Geneva, U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville said “These are shocking and shameful comments from the president of the United States. There is no other word one can use but ‘racist.'” \nThe reported language was the latest in a long string of anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim comments by Trump that have been condemned as racist. He also blamed “both sides” after a white supremacist rally in August in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned violent and a woman protesting against the rally was killed. \nDurbin said that despite Trump’s rejection of the bipartisan deal he would introduce it as legislation next week and work on getting Democratic and Republican support for passage. \n“We have seven days and the clock is ticking. Our bipartisan group continues to build support for the only deal in town,” Durbin said in a statement on Friday. \nHe was referring to Jan. 19, when funds for operating federal agencies expires. Durbin and other lawmakers want the immigration measure to be attached to a must-do bill to fund the government beyond that date. \nIn recent days, a group of Republican and Democratic leaders from the House and Senate have met with the stated goal of crafting an alternative to the Senate bipartisan deal. But there was no indication that those four leaders were planning to meet over the long Martin Luther King Day federal holiday weekend or when they might produce legislation. \nReporting by Doina Chiacu, Richard Cowan, Susan Heavey and Roberta Rampton; Additional reporting by Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva, Guyler Delva in Port-au-Prince, Ed Stoddard in Johannesburg, Chris Mfula in Lusaka, Terje Solsvik and Camilla Knudsen in Oslo, Nelson Renteria in San Salvador; Writing by James Oliphant; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Frances Kerry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T14:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T14:43:42.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

( Jobs resigned in August 2011 .) Also, Fadell was the Senior Vice President in charge of the iPod division from Jan 2001 through March 2010. He has been called one of the \"fathers of the iPod\" for his work on the personal music player. Fadell also founded and was the CEO of home regulation system Nest and the marketing company Fuse.\nFadell recommends big tech turn over usage data to third parties who can build apps to monitor the amount of time being spent looking at screens.\nRead the salient points:\nUK adults spend 8+ hrs on screens/day, children 6.5 hrs. Don't ignore the link betw social media use & depression. 34% of people checked Facebook in the last 10 minutes.\nAdmitting you have an addiction is Step 1.\nWe need to control our own environment & we need information:\nApple Watches, Google Phones, Facebook, Twitter - they've gotten so good at getting us to go for another click, another dopamine hit. They now have a responsibility & need to start helping us track & manage our digital addictions across all usages - phone, laptop, TV etc.\nThey're the only ones who can do this -\nThey need to give access to that information to 3rd-party apps, so that we can manage & limit our time on them, control notifications, etc. There will a lot of great startups that will create useful tools to help us become balanced - digital & analog - again…\nWith (or without) these tools, it's up to us to act:\nThe comments from Fadell come as consumer addiction to technology is top of mind.\nTwo prominent investors in Apple — Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, or Calstrs — sent a letter to the Cupertino-based tech behemoth on Saturday pointing out the extent to which young people are addicted to their smartphones. (Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, or Calstrs own $2 billion worth of Apple stock.)\n\"More than 10 years after the iPhone's release, it is a cliché to point out the ubiquity of Apple's devices among children and teenagers, as well as the attendant growth in social media use by this group. What is less well known is that there is a growing body of evidence that, for at least some of the most frequent young users, this may be having unintentional negative consequences,\" the letter says.\nApple has responded to the letter. Since 2008, parental controls have been available for many Apple products, the company points out.\n\"Apple has always looked out for kids, and we work hard to create powerful products that inspire, entertain, and educate children while also helping parents protect them online. We lead the industry by offering intuitive parental controls built right into the operating system,\" Apple says in a statement shared with CNBC Make It .\n\"We think deeply about how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them. We take this responsibility very seriously and we are committed to meeting and exceeding our customers' expectations, especially when it comes to protecting kids.\"\nApple did not respond to the claim that adults are also addicted to their technology.\nTwitter declined to comment.\nFacebook and Google had not responded to request for comment by the time this story was published.\nFadell pressed Apple to respond to the claim for adults, too.\nIndeed, Adam Alter, an associate professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University, wrote a book, \" Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked, \" making the case that in addition to kids, adults are addicted to technology.\n\"We're biologically prone to getting hooked on these sorts of experiences. If you put someone in front of a slot machine, their brain will look qualitatively the same as when they take heroin. If you're someone who compulsively plays video games — not everyone, but people who are addicted to a particular game — the minute you load up your computer, your brain will look like that of a substance abuser,\" Alter tells the New York Times . \"I find it interesting that the late Steve Jobs said in a 2010 interview that his own children didn't use iPads.\"\nAlter uses himself as an example: \"I'm addicted to email. I can't stop checking it. I can't go to bed at night if I haven't cleared my inbox. I'll keep my phone next to my bed, much as I try not to,\" says Alter.\n\"The technology is designed to hook us that way. Email is bottomless. Social media platforms are endless. Twitter? The feed never really ends. You could sit there 24 hours a day and you'll never get to the end. And so you come back for more and more,\" he tells the Times.\nAnd according to Fadell's tweets, it's not hard to implement tools that would allow consumers to moderate their usage. He knows it, and so does Apple, he says.\nThx to my friends @apple for your 1st response. It's not about only kids, adults need them for themselves too. U & I know it's technically EASY to build usage info & control tools. Looking fwd to many bold announcements @ WWDC in June on this imprtnt topic\nThis story has been updated to include a response from Tony Fadell and Twitter.\nSee also:\nHow Amazon founder Jeff Bezos went from the son of a teen mom to the world's richest person, his wealth topping $105 billion\n8 ways artificial intelligence is going to change the way you live, work and play in 2018\nTony Robbins: This is the difference between people who stick to their New Year's resolutions and those who don't\nshow chapters This CEO wants to put a computer chip in your brain 10:35 AM ET Wed, 12 April 2017 | 01:15 Like this story?

Li led a senior delegation on a daylong official visit Thursday to Cambodia, China's close ally. \nAmong the major agreements was building a new expressway more than 200 kilometers (125 miles) long linking the capital, Phnom Penh, with the resort city of Sihanoukville, and a new Phnom Penh international Airport. \nCambodian Public Work and Transport Minister Sun Chanthol told The Associated Press after the signing that China will invest some $2 billion for the highway. He said the project is set to start this year and will take at least 44 months to complete. \nChina is Cambodia's key ally and economic partner.

The memo also signaled banks could do business with these companies so long as they were in compliance with federal guidelines, although many have been hesitant. \nIn rescinding this policy, Sessions said future prosecutions of businesses and individuals who sell pot in states where it has been legalized will be left up to individual U.S. attorneys. \n\"The real sticking point here will be banking. Before, banks were very reluctant to do business based on the loosely defined Cole Memo,\" said Matt Karnes, founder of industry analyst firm GreenWave Advisors. \"This raises more uncertainty, and I think there is going to be a pullback.\" \nIn a November 2017 report, GreenWave found that about 5 percent, or 368, of all financial institutions in the U.S. are on record with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), but only 1 percent are actually servicing these businesses. Many are credit unions and local and community banks. Karnes also said many marijuana businesses conceal the true nature of their business when establishing relationships, and once they are found out, the account is shut down. \n\"In the last report from FinCEN, 3,800 accounts were opened, but 3,700 were shut down. It's very short-lived,\" he said. \nA report from Reuters Wednesday also indicated the action taken by Sessions came as a surprise to FinCEN, which was flooded with calls from banks on how to proceed. CNBC reached out to both the Department of Justice and FinCEN for comment but did not immediately receive a response. Boom for security businesses? \nMore cash on hand for the foreseeable future means ancillary companies that specialize in security but don't touch the plant may see an increase in business. \nDallas-based Sapphire Risk Advisory Group offers security solutions for more than 100 cannabis companies in 18 states and Canada. Managing partner Tony Gallo said he received calls from clients old and new in the past week seeking advice and new business in the wake of Sessions' action. \n\"Our clients are concerned about whether their security is adequate at this time in their locations, whether it's a grow facility or dispensary. And then new clients that are looking to come on board wanted to know what kind of security they're going to be required to have going forward,\" Gallo said. \nGallo anticipates banks will further retreat, which means his business stands to benefit. About 70 percent of the businesses he works with have banking relationships, he said. \n\"I think the banking and insurance industries have been very hesitant to conduct business in the cannabis arena prior to the Cole Memo coming out, and I think they will continue to be. It will probably get worse. That then sends messages to bad people that these locations will have a large amount of cash on hand,\" he said. \"That's the concern a lot of our clients had — safeguarding their cash now that they may have trouble going to the bank.\" Industry still primed for growth \nOne thing that hasn't shifted since Sessions' action are the growth projections firms have put forward for the industry. \nMarijuana Business Daily estimates medicinal and recreational sales will hit $6 billion in the U.S. this year and will triple in the next four to five years, fueled primarily by a new recreational market in California. \nThe more bullish GreenWave is projecting $12.8 billion this year and more than $30 billion by 2021, assuming there is a medicinal or recreational market in every state nationwide. Both groups said they are not changing their projections just yet. \n\"Basically you have a freight train moving at 200 miles per hour, and Jeff Sessions is trying to jump out of a bush and stick out his leg to slow this down,\" said Chris Walsh, vice president of editorial for Marijuana Business Daily. \"It is going to run him over. So I think it might have some type of a chilling effect in some areas, but in general, the industry is going to be moving and growing quickly and will continue to move forward.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T22:02:39.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

There's an increasing mismatch between what GOP party leaders believe and what the rank-and-file \"base\" believes . House Speaker Paul Ryan and other top Republicans aim to convince Trump to break his campaign promises, not keep them. SHARES Getty Images (L-R) House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX) applaud with their fellow House Republicans during a news conference following the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the Rayburn Room at the U.S. Capitol November 16, 2017 in Washington, DC. \nQuestions about Donald Trump 's fitness for the presidency turn next week to a broader question — about his party's fitness to run the government. \nIt arises, once again, as the Republican-controlled Congress faces a January 19 deadline for providing the money necessary to keep federal agencies open for business. In recent years, the GOP has repeatedly struggled to meet this basic responsibility. \nThat difficulty reflects the zeal of a staunchly conservative minority fueled by decades of Republican attacks on government. It has led, in turn, to a debilitating mismatch between what party leaders believe and what the rank-and-file \"base\" believes, with voluble encouragement lately from President Trump. \nThus the president's campaign pledge to build \"The Wall\" along America's Southern border, financed by Mexico, still looms as an obstacle to a spending deal that keeps the government open. show chapters 12:05 PM ET Wed, 10 Jan 2018 | 04:29 \nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) openly mocked Trump's pledge before the 2016 election. Senate Republican Whip John Cornyn of Texas says \"it makes no sense.\" White House chief of staff John Kelly has conceded a wall \"from sea to shining sea\" probably will never happen. \nYet Trump told reporters this week that any spending deal \"has got to include The Wall.\" If conservative pressure impels him to insist on a massive concrete barrier — instead of the window-dressing border security measures his aides have suggested — the government will shut down. \nEven if he doesn't, Republicans lack the internal consensus to sustain government funding. They'll need help from Democrats — as they did a few months ago to avert a crisis by raising the federal debt limit. \nThe president's first budget sought $50 billion more for the Pentagon, financed by deep cuts in domestic spending. That approach has surface appeal for the majority of Republican voters who tell pollsters most government spending is wasted on useless projects, undeserving recipients, foreign aid, and the like. show chapters 3 Hours Ago | 04:39 \nSenior congressional Republicans don't believe that, however. \"We don't pay attention\" to Trump's requested cuts, veteran GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee told me recently, and instead have moved to increase spending on key domestic priorities, such as scientific research. \nInstead, Republicans want to curb spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits, which consume half the federal budget. The problem: Those benefits are popular and Trump promised not to touch them. \nSo Speaker Ryan and other top Republicans aim to convince Trump to break his campaign promises, not keep them. They've had some success; Trump's failed attempt to repeal Obamacare would have slashed Medicaid. show chapters 9:02 AM ET Tue, 9 Jan 2018 | 23:00 \nOn taxes, Republican leaders persuaded Trump to abandon his vow that the wealthy would not benefit. In fact, economic forecasters say they'll benefit most, in large part through lower rates on businesses they own. As Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker said before backing the plan, lower corporate tax rates were the point to begin with. \nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has reverse-engineered the justification that it was designed for middle-class families. Polls show most voters don't buy it. \nThe same gap between GOP leadership and rank-and-file hobbles the party on other economic issues. In 2016, Trump told beleaguered blue-collar whites their problems stemmed from governmental incompetence, lax immigration policies, and bad trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA — not irreversible economic trends such as technological change and mobility of global capital. \nRepublican leaders, who back continued trade expansion, don't believe that. They want Trump to abandon his threat to leave NAFTA to avoid what Robert Zoellick, President George W. Bush 's former trade representative, warned would be \"economic mayhem.\" \nThese mismatched Republican views reflect how Trump's crude populist messages twisted the 2016 electorate into a historically unprecedented shape. Most of his votes came from Americans without college degrees, the people most vulnerable to economic and cultural changes. Republicans playing key roles in politics and business come from the ranks of college-credentialed winners — just as most of Hillary Clinton 's voters did. \nAs advocates of smaller government, Republican leaders have mostly stood by while Trump erodes the executive branch administratively. The White House has failed to nominate anyone for 40 percent of top posts requiring Senate confirmation. GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona has expressed alarm over the number of U.S. diplomats who have left under pressure from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson , who himself is repeatedly undercut by the president. \nBeyond his disdain for expertise, Trump has strong personal motivation to hobble the government he heads. He fired FBI Director James Comey over what he calls the Russia \"witch hunt\" probing the president's 2016 campaign. He keeps it up even though special counsel Robert Mueller holds such a sterling reputation that Trump himself considered appointing Mueller to lead the FBI. \nHis party increasingly amplifies those attacks. As much as they disagree with rank-and-file Trump supporters, GOP leaders in government fear them. \nCorrection: This article was updated to reflect Sen. Bob Corker's home state.

Reconsidering Amazon AWS.\" \nWininger later followed up, saying Amazon's poaching of employees from customers, like Lemonade, is a \"breach of confidence.\" He also added the \"obscene amount of money\" being offered to steal his employees could end up damaging the entire Israeli start-up market. \nIn a separate Facebook post , Wininger wrote, \"Game on! Werner Vogels FYI,\" tagging Vogels, Amazon's chief technology officer. \nWininger's complaint is the latest evidence of the growing tension between Amazon and emerging tech companies. Last year, Amazon irked some start-ups after releasing a product that looked and worked almost the same as a device made by Nucleus , one of its Alexa Fund portfolio companies. It could also cripple Amazon's effort to expand its presence in Israel, a start-up powerhouse with some of the world's best technical talent. \nAs Wininger's posts gained traction, Vogels eventually left a comment underneath it, indicating he doesn't support Amazon's poaching from its customers. \n\"Let me dive into this,\" Vogels wrote in the comments section of the Facebook post. \"It may be a sourcing agency vs Amazon proper. I find that sourcing from our customers would be extremely counter-effective.\" Talent war \nAmir Konigsberg, CEO of the Tel Aviv-based start-up Twiggle, said the problem isn't necessarily about Amazon stealing start-up employees, but rather the aggressive nature of its poaching. \nHe pointed out that Amazon has been \"systematically\" reaching out to groups of employees working on specific projects within start-ups, putting them at risk of losing an entire team at once. Konigsberg, who formerly led Google's expansion in Israel, said Amazon is much more aggressive than other multinational companies, like Google or Facebook. \n\"Talent war is fine but you have to remain respectful,\" Konigsberg said, adding Amazon is hurting its relationship with the rest of the Israeli tech community. \"It's very important to keep an equilibrium with how you operate. Apple, Google, and FB all have lots of money, but you haven't seen these kinds of complaints happening about them.\" show chapters 6:31 PM ET Tue, 29 Aug 2017 | 00:58 \nThe bigger problem for Amazon is that it may be hurting itself. \nIn the comments section under Wininger's post, a number of Israeli start-up CEOs said they're considering other cloud vendors because of Amazon's actions. That would add to the flood of companies avoiding AWS, a group that includes a number of big-box retailers like Walmart, Target , and Kroger. \nAmazon did not respond to requests for comment. \n\"We spend nearly $2,000,000 / year on AWS, yet Amazon recruiters are aggressively trying to poach our developers in TLV,\" wrote Liad Agmon, CEO of Tel Aviv-based Dynamic Yield. \"It's a data point I'm seriously considering as part of our internal debate whether to stick with Amazon or switch to Google cloud.\" \nGiven Amazon's massive share in the cloud space, it's hard to imagine this will have a material impact on AWS. But it's at least opening the doors for competitors to reach out with better offers, as one Google Cloud salesperson did on LinkedIn. \n\"Google Cloud would love to have you — shoot me a message,\" the Google representative wrote under Wininger's post.

The Miller Tabak straegist explains why.\n\n• Everybody seems to be asking the question of whether higher interest rates will mean higher competition for stocks, but this is missing the point. The real issue is what impact higher rates have on leverage, as there's more leverage in the financial system than ever before as measured by total worldwide debt.\n\n• Furthermore, corporate firms' margin debt in the U.S. sits near all-time highs. As rates move higher, the cost of that leverage goes up, and eventually leverage will have to be unwound.\n\n• The kind of unwinding won't appear as it did during the financial crisis, but a meaningful move about 2.6 percent on the U.S. 10-year yield will likely cause a headwind for the stock market.

During his campaign, Trump promised to dump it, calling the it \"the worst deal ever.\"\nThe JCPOA, enacted in 2015 by Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany, allowed the lifting of international sanctions on Iran in exchange for compliance with restrictions on its nuclear program. Between January 12 and 17, sanctions on foreign oil purchases, insurance, shipping, banking, and oil and gas investment are due for waiver.\nOil markets at risk Any U.S. disruption to the deal could shake oil markets, according to a report by Citigroup's global commodities team published Tuesday.

The U.S. president is required to recertify Iran's compliance to its terms once every 90 days.\nThis time around, Trump is likely to concede that Iran is complying with the deal but that it's not in the U.S.'s national security interest, said Richard Nephew, a former coordinator for sanctions policy at the U.S. State Department and senior fellow at the Brookings Institute. Congress then has a following 60 days to either re-impose sanctions on Iran or do nothing.\nNon-nuclear sanctions \"The only real outstanding question is what Donald Trump thinks and will choose to do. Contacts within his administration ... have reported that the decision is effectively a 'coin flip' now,\" Nephew wrote in a commentary for Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy on Tuesday.

However, he noted, the U.S. is only one of six international signatories to the deal. \"Lawmakers can amend the domestic legislation but cannot change the deal itself without the backing of other parties, which is unlikely to materialize.\"\nNew sanctions would likely be aimed both at Iran's missile program and its activities in the region, despite opposition from other deal signatories, the Citi report said. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Shia militant group Hezbollah, which the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization, are the predominant targets.\n\"The not-so-subtle threat is one that could materialize in a worst case scenario, which could see Iran use Trump's decision as justification to pull out of the agreement and restart its nuclear program.\" -Ryan Turner, lead risk analyst at Protection Group International \"Although too small to directly impact the economy, [the sanctions] will serve to further damage much needed investor sentiment towards Iran,\" Pat Thaker, regional director for the Middle East and Africa at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC Thursday.

Kim said \"a balanced perspective is necessary because blockchain technology has high relevance with many industries such as security and logistics.\" \nKim's comments followed news that the country's justice ministry appeared to have softened its stance after remarks from its chief on Thursday saw billions wiped off the global cryptocurrency market . \nThe justice ministry explained, according to Yonhap, that the ban was not a done deal in a text message to reporters on Thursday. \n\"The ministry has been preparing a special law to shut down all cryptocurrency exchanges, but we will push for it after careful consideration with related government agencies,\" the justice ministry said. \nCNBC reached out to the justice ministry for further clarification, but did not immediately hear back. \nOn Thursday, Justice Minister Park Sang-ki said at a press briefing that there were \"great concerns regarding virtual currencies\" and that the ministry was \"basically preparing a bill to ban cryptocurrency trading through exchanges.\" \nPark said he couldn't disclose more specific details about a proposed shutdown of cryptocurrency trading exchanges in the country, adding that various government agencies would work together to implement several measures. \nNews of his ministry's plans roiled the cryptocurrency market and bitcoin price fell as much as 12 percent in the aftermath. \nLater in the day, however, South Korea's presidential office emphasized that any potential bill is not a final measure. \n\"Justice Minister Park Sang-ki's remarks regarding the shutdown of cryptocurrency exchanges is one of the measures that have been prepared by the Justice Ministry, but it is not a finalized decision and will be finalized through discussion and a coordination process with each government ministry,\" the chief press secretary to President Moon Jae-in said in a statement reported by Yonhap. \nEven if a bill aiming to ban all cryptocurrency trading is drafted, it will require a majority vote in the country's National Assembly before it can be enacted into law. That process could take months — or even years. \nOn Friday afternoon at 12:42 p.m. HK/SIN, bitcoin traded at $13,613.99 and ethereum traded at $1,205.83, according to CoinDesk data. \nSouth Korea is one of the biggest markets for major coins like bitcoin and ethereum. \nAccording to industry website CryptoCompare, more than 11 percent of ethereum is traded against the South Korean won — the second largest concentration in terms of fiat currencies behind the dollar. Meanwhile, around 5 percent of all bitcoin are traded against the won. \nOne industry player told CNBC's \" Squawk Box \" on Friday morning that he didn't think South Korea would actually ban cryptocurrency trading in the country. \n\"(South) Korea is the third-largest bitcoin trading market in the world after Japan and the U.S.,\" Dave Chapman, managing director at Hong Kong-based commodities and digital assets trading house Octagon Strategy, said. \n\"Given the acceptance of cryptocurrency as a whole, and now its further adoption, and the appreciation of the entire market, it's hardly surprising to think that regulators are looking at this with some scrutiny,\" he added. \nChapman explained that it's understandable that regulators are looking closely at what's happening in the cryptocurrency space. \n\"From a regulator's perspective, they are trying to do the right thing. It's about consumer protection and given that the heightened sort of fever in this asset class, it is right that they're looking into this further,\" he said. \nCryptocurrency trading South Korea is very speculative and the prices of bitcoin, ethereum and other coins are significantly higher than elsewhere in the world. Authorities have taken steps in recent months to limit speculation in the market, including prohibiting cryptocurrency exchanges from issuing new trading accounts. \nLast month, the government also said it would consider taxing capital gains from trading of virtual coins, according to Reuters. \n— CNBC's Chery Kang and Reuters contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T02:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T03:37:37.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

McMaster has been the most vocal of Trump’s aides arguing for a more active military approach, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the military leadership have urged caution, stressing the need to exhaust diplomatic options, according to five officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nA White House National Security Council official said the administration was “constantly developing a range of options, both military and non-military” but declined to address any differences between senior aides.\nThe Pentagon declined comment on internal discussions, though one spokesman said Mattis had stressed in public that the effort to confront the North Korean crisis was diplomatically led. The State Department referred to Tillerson’s statements on the need to pursue diplomacy backed by strong military options.\nAccording to the narrative put forth by those advocating a tougher response, a strike could be limited to a single target with the aim of making Kim see reason, not to topple his government, something North Korea’s neighbor and only major ally, China, would not countenance, the officials said.\n“Trump is convinced the only thing Kim understands and respects is a punch in the face, which he thinks no previous administration has had the guts to do,” one U.S. official said.\n“At a minimum, he thinks that warning the Chinese about a preemptive strike would motivate Beijing to force Kim to shut down the programs that threaten the U.S.,” the official said.\nIt remains unclear whether these disclosures by people close to the internal deliberations were simply psychological warfare aimed at sowing strategy-changing fear within the North Korean leadership or reflected Trump’s serious intent.However, the administration’s debate on whether to put greater emphasis on strike plans has slowed because of the North-South contacts and February’s Winter Olympics to be hosted by South Korea. Pyongyang said it would send a delegation.\nSome U.S. officials have suggested that North Korea was using diplomatic overtures to try to drive a wedge between Washington and ally Seoul and did not intend to engage seriously. The South and the United States are technically still at war with the North because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.\nA new dawn: tmsnrt.rs/2Ar8lUu\n‘WHO KNOWS WHERE IT LEADS?’\nTrump’s public response to the intra-Korean meeting has been mostly positive though at times tinged with skepticism.\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson concludes his remarks on the U.S.-Korea relationship during a forum at the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC, U.S. December 12, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo “Who knows where it leads?” he told reporters on Wednesday after discussing the talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, a long-time advocate of dialogue with Pyongyang and whose capital Seoul could be devastated in any major conflict.\nTrump, who has exchanged insults and threats with Kim in recent months, was Quote: d on Thursday as telling the Wall Street Journal in an interview: “I probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un.” Trump offered no details and asked whether he had spoken with Kim, said: “I don’t want to comment on it. I‘m not saying I have or I haven‘t.”\nThe administration had been due to hold a Cabinet-level meeting this week to sharpen its economic and military options for dealing with North Korea.\nBut officials say this discussion has been postponed until after the Paralympic Games, which follow the Olympics and end in March, given the intra-Korean talks and a planned 20-country meeting on North Korea hosted by Canada next week.\nThe Vancouver meeting, aimed at increasing the U.S.-led pressure campaign against Pyongyang, was announced by Washington just after North Korea’s last intercontinental ballistic missile test in late November.\nOne U.S. official said one option would be to bomb a North Korean missile or nuclear facility based on a “high confidence” intelligence assessment that North Korea planned another test. Such a strike could be triggered by evidence that North Korea was fueling an ICBM, the official said. Another option would be a retaliatory strike on an ICBM or nuclear site after a test, another official said.\nThe officials said McMaster has argued that if China were assured that a strike would be limited to one target and not the beginning of a campaign to overthrow Kim, an all-out war could be avoided.\nChinese political experts said China was opposed to even limited strikes.\nHowever, Zhao Tong, a North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing, said China’s attitude might change if North Korea launched a nuclear-tipped ICBM into the Pacific Ocean or fired missiles toward Guam.\nChina sees the Trump administration’s discussion of military options as a psychological game to force Beijing and Moscow to maintain pressure on Pyongyang, but they were making crisis preparations just in case, Zhao said.\n“Even if Trump is not really serious about a military strike, there is always the risk of miscalculation or an over-reaction from North Korea,” Zhao said.\nA South Korean official said Seoul believed the chance of a U.S. strike was still low. “President Trump is aware of the consequences. He’s been advised by a lot of agencies and departments of the damage it would cause and the number of victims,” the official said.\nThe prevailing view at the State Department is that military action is not worth the huge risk, a senior U.S. official said.\nHowever, the official said, “there are military options that could achieve benefits we consider in our national interest at a cost we are willing to bear.”\nThe consensus among U.S. intelligence agencies is Kim is convinced Washington seeks to overthrow him and only a nuclear arsenal can deter that.\nA Japanese ruling party lawmaker said he did not believe the Korean talks could narrow the gap between North Korea’s demand for recognition as a nuclear-armed state and the U.S. refusal to accept that.\n“It may be dangerous after the Olympics,” the lawmaker said.\nReporting by David Brunnstrom, Matt Spetalnick, John Walcott and Phil Stewart in Washington,; Josh Smith, Hyonghee Shin and Soyoung Kim in Seoul, Christian Shepherd in Beijing and Nobohiro Kubo and Linda Sieg in Tokyo; editing by Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T01:14:33.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It raised its profit outlook for 2018 by around 20 percent, citing the new tax legislation.\nDelta said passenger revenue rose in all of the regions where it operates, the first time it posted across-the-board gains in five years. The airline's shares were up more than 5 percent in afternoon trading.\nBut Delta, like its rivals, such as American and United , which report later this month, faced higher fuel costs last year and is now grappling with oil prices at multi-year highs. \nFuel prices still climbing Delta said its fuel expense rose $350 million in the third quarter, and that it paid an average of $1.93 a gallon. It expects to pay around $2.05 to $2.10 a gallon in the first three months of this year.\n\"I think the biggest thing we have going in our favor in 2018 is a strong economy with a lot of optimism,\" Delta's CEO Ed Bastian said on an earnings call Thursday. He admitted, however, that fuel \"is a little bit of a wild card.\"\nThe U.S. economy grew 3.2 percent in the third quarter, the biggest increase for the July through September period, in two years, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.\nCorporate travel revenue last quarter grew at the fastest clip since 2014, the airline said, adding that it will likely continue this year.\nCorporate travel will rise more than 6 percent this year, the highest growth rate since 2011, Deloitte recently estimated.\nEarlier this week, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said the new tax legislation would boost business-travel spending this year and that would help boost shares of Delta, United and American, which are heavily reliant on corporate travel revenue. Delta said the tax law would likely spur more corporate travel spending.\nBut investors will task Delta to keep a lid on increasing costs, which the airline expects to rise 2 percent to 4 percent this quarter, not including fuel. Delta said it would try to trim costs for hotels, transportation and fleet management.\nHigher costs will hurt its ability to grow profits in the first three months of the year, it said, forecasting earnings of between 60 and 80 cents a share, below the 83 cents a share forecast by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.\nDelta has been restrained when it comes to growing capacity and expects to upgrade to larger aircraft to meet some of the increasing demand. It expects to grow capacity around 3 percent this quarter, while increasing revenue per each seat it flies — a key industry metric — to a gain of 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent. Too much growth can lead to depressed fares, which tends to spook investors.\nPassengers are opening their wallets Not only are planes flying fuller, but passengers are willing to shell out more for higher fares. Delta, like its competitors, have sliced up their economy cabins and rolled out new premium cabins to encourage passengers to pay for more room on board and other amenities.\nDelta's president Glen Hauenstein said its so-called branded fares generated $200 million in the fourth quarter, and revenues from upselling passengers on first-class seats and its Comfort+ economy seats increased between 25 percent and 30 percent. \nThose types of fares will contribute $350 million in incremental revenue this year. Delta has said it's bare-bones basic economy fares, which offer little flexibility and no free checked bags, are intended to drive passengers to a more expensive, full-service economy fare. Delta is taking those fares global this year .\nRevenue from its co-branded credit card program with American Express is also on the rise. It said it logged more than 1 million signups for SkyMiles credit card accounts in 2017, an annual record. Delta and other airlines make money by selling airline miles to credit card issuers and those issuers in turn receive new customers.\nNo taxes...yet Because of years of losses in the past, Delta and some other airlines don't pay taxes because of what's known as deferred tax assets. The airline could become a taxpayer in 2019 and 2020, it said, in which case it would be at the the new lower rate. \nOther challenges ahead There are some curveballs Delta has to face this year. Its order for at least 75 Bombardier are stuck in a trade dispute with rival plane-maker Boeing , which complained that its Canadian counterpart sold them to Delta below cost and received illegal government subsidies for the program. So far, the Trump administration has sided with Boeing and recommended tariffs of almost 300 percent on the planes, which seat around 100 to 125 passengers.\nA final ruling is expected later this month and Delta said it doesn't expect to take delivery of the planes this spring, as planned. To match demand, Bastian said the airline is investing in maintaining MD-88 jets, which it intends to retire soon, \"around a bit longer than we were otherwise anticipating. \"\nDelta recently agreed to buy 100 single-aisle Airbus jets , but those don't arrive until 2020.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T22:02:45.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Dinner in particular can be a real budget buster . \nIt didn't take long living in New York City to realize that one meal out can easily set you back $20. Throw in a drink or two and your tab can be twice that. \nWhen I was challenged to make five dinners on a budget of $20 for this week's Cash Diet challenge , I wasn't too worried. Living off pasta and eggs for a week wouldn't be too bad. But then I read the catch, which complicated things: Each meal had to be different. And they each had to contain a carb, protein and vegetable. \nI don't have much experience cooking, so I consulted an expert: Joel Gamoran , National Chef for Sur La Table and host of the cooking show \" SCRAPS .\" He helped me whip up homemade brunch for six on a budget of $30 , so I figured he'd have some good ideas for this week's challenge. \nBefore helping me plan my meals for the week, Joel gave me some tips for grocery shopping on a tight budget: \n1. Expand your shopping list. In other words, buy ingredients that make your dollar go further. Joel suggested I use pasta and couscous, which are both cheap and filling, as my carbs for the week. \nHe also suggested getting an entire chicken, rather than just the thighs or breasts, and stretching it across three meals. That way, I could use the bones to make a chicken broth, which would be a helpful (and completely free!) ingredient. \nJoel said it was fine to buy a rotisserie chicken, even though they tend to be pricier than raw ones . The pre-cooked chicken would save me time and stress. And, since chicken would be my main source of protein for the week, I couldn't risk ruining an uncooked one. \n2. Price compare and shop outside of your neighborhood. While it may be more convenient to shop at your go-to grocery store, it's worth it to stop by someone else's local market for cheaper produce. \nFactors like storage, refrigeration and shipping can drive up the prices at national grocery stores, so you can generally score much better deals at small markets that get their produce from local farms and wholesalers. \nThat said, shopping at multiple spots can get time consuming. When price comparing, keep in mind that your time is also valuable. CNBC Make It Scoring deals on produce in Chinatown \n3. Keep it simple. Rather than buying a ton of different ingredients, find ways to get creative with a few staples . Mix and match what you're working with so you're not stuck eating the same thing over and over. You'd be surprised with how far a little bit of creativity can go . \nBefore you head out to shop, make a list of exactly what you need and stick to it. No impulse buys! And if you're worried about going over your food budget, try using cash. Decide out how much you want to spend on food on that particular grocery trip and withdraw only that amount. When you head to the store, don't bring your credit cards so you're not tempted to use them. \nI grabbed a $20 bill before heading out to price compare at Trader Joe's, Whole Foods and the markets in Chinatown. Here's what I got for the week: \nCarbs: 1 box of couscous, 1 bag of pasta \nVegetables: Sweet potatoes, frozen peas, carrots, broccoli \nProtein: 1 dozen eggs, 1 rotisserie chicken \nOther: 1 can of coconut milk \nI'm no chef, but with just $20, nine ingredients and a few basic recipes from Joel, I was able to make five healthy and filling dinners, each involving a carb, veggie and protein. \nHere's a breakdown of what I made each night: Day 1: Roasted chicken and sweet potatoes \nPrepping meal No. 1 was a true confidence builder: All I had to do was chop a few sweet potatoes, drizzle some olive oil over them and stick them in the oven for about 20 minutes. \nWhile the potatoes were roasting, I cut up about one-third of my rotisserie chicken and heated it in a frying pan. Since I wasn't sure if sweet potatoes could double as a veggie and a carb, I chopped up some carrots on the side to make sure I fulfilled the challenge requirements. Day 2: Twice-baked sweet potato \nThis meal was a bit more time intensive, but completely worth the kitchen labor. Baked sweet potatoes are also uncharted territory for me — let alone twice baked sweet potatoes — so I didn't know what to expect. \nLuckily, the recipe is easier than it sounds: I started by baking one sweet potato until it was soft enough to slice and remove the flesh. While my potato was in the oven, I chopped up my broccoli and carrots and steamed them to make them softer. I then scooped out the flesh of the baked potato and, in a separate bowl, combined it with my veggies. \nFinally, I piled the mixture back into the potato skin, popped my loaded potato back into the oven and baked it until it was golden brown. I topped it off with a beautiful egg over easy to fulfill the protein requirement. Day 3: Pasta carbonara with peas \nMy go-to dinner has always been buttery pasta: Pasta with butter melted on top. It's quick, tasty and filling. \nTurns out, pasta carbonara is just as easy to make … and tastes way better. \nI started by cooking a generous portion of spaghetti. While the noodles were boiling, I whisked together two eggs, a splash of whole milk and a handful of frozen peas. When the pasta was done, I drained it, immediately added the hot noodles to the egg mixture and voila! \nMost carbonara sauces are made with Parmesan cheese, which was out of my price range this week. For a more complete pasta carbonara recipe, check out this one . Day 4: Chicken curry stir fry \nOn day four, couscous became my new best friend. It's impossible to mess up and took just five minutes to cook, which is much faster than rice and even speedier than pasta. Plus, it's delicious. \nWhile the couscous was cooking, I combined another third of my rotisserie chicken — shredded — a handful of frozen peas, one cup of coconut milk and a sprinkle of curry powder in a separate pan. I let the mixture simmer for a bit and then poured it on top of the couscous to create a chicken curry-esque meal. Day 5: Chicken fried \"rice\" \nThe last day was particularly exciting because I got to use my homemade chicken broth, which I prepared earlier in the week. You can follow a more detailed recipe , but here are the basic instructions: Put your chicken carcass in a pot with water, bring it to a boil and then let it simmer for about four hours. \nMy take on chicken fried rice first involved cooking the couscous in my homemade broth, which added great flavor. I steamed what was left of my veggies — a few carrots and peas — tossed them in with the cooked couscous and added my favorite topper: eggs. \nWhile this challenge required some planning and creativity in the kitchen, $20 was more than enough to make five healthy and filling dinners. I even had leftovers some nights, and since each meal was so different, I didn't mind packing the extras for lunch for the week. \nAll-in-all, I spent an average of $4 per dinner. And the best part: You don't need to know much — or anything — about cooking at all to pull these meals off. If I can make them, almost anyone can.

U.S. Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service officials did not respond to Reuters' queries seeking comment.\n\"This is clearly the result of rushed legislation,\" said Shay, formerly a top Treasury Department tax official.\nThe sweeping Republican tax law was President Donald Trump 's first major legislative triumph since he took office almost a year ago. Rushed through Congress, and approved over the unanimous opposition of Democrats, it took effect this month, delivering tax cuts and tax code changes that large, U.S.-based multinationals had sought for years.\nOne of those changes was a one-time tax break on about $2.6 trillion in profits that multinationals have socked away overseas in recent years under a \"deferral\" rule that let companies hold profits offshore tax-free, as long as the money was not brought into the United States, or repatriated.\nThere is no such deferral under the new law and accumulated overseas profits will now be taxed at either 15.5 percent for cash holdings or at 8 percent for more illiquid investments.\nBoth rates are far below the 35 percent rate that would have been charged on repatriated foreign profits before the law was passed, and below a new 21 percent corporate income tax rate.\nTo knock their taxes even lower, experts said, multinationals could have leeway to shift foreign earnings into the 8 percent tax bracket and out of the 15.5 percent bracket.\n\"Even before the legislation was unveiled in November, multinationals were planning to convert cash to non-cash assets, although it wasn't entirely clear what would constitute cash for this purpose,\" said Reuven Avi-Yonah, a leading tax expert at the University of Michigan Law School.\nThe loophole that makes the bracket-shifting possible involves a formula for calculating how much foreign earnings are subject to the higher tax rate. The benchmark is a company's foreign cash position, calculated as the greater of either the average of the past two tax years, or the cash balance at the end of the last tax year begun before Jan. 1, 2018.\nCompanies would pay the 15.5 percent rate on sums up to the calculated foreign cash position. Anything over that would get the 8 percent rate.\nShay said some multinationals could reduce their cash positions, and the amount of money subject to the higher rate, through legitimate distributions including dividend payments.\nHe estimated Apple could have as much as $289 billion in foreign cash at the end of its current fiscal year on Sept. 30. Averaged across the last two tax years, the figure would be $234 billion.\nTo avoid paying 15.5 percent on the higher of those two figures, he said, Apple could distribute some of its cash through dividends or other means. Reducing its 2018 position by $55 billion to the lower, two-year average would save the company more than $4 billion in taxes, according to Shay.\nThe new law says transactions meant principally to reduce taxes due on foreign profits can be disregarded by U.S. tax authorities. But tax experts said this anti-abuse measure does not apply automatically and that corporate tax lawyers could argue it does not apply to legitimate corporate actions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T17:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T17:26:58.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Carried interest has been U.S. law for more than 50 years as an incentive for long-term investment.\nTop Trump economic advisor Gary Cohn said last month after the Republican tax bill was finalized that he regretted that carried interest was not cut.\n\"We would have cut carried interest,\" Cohn told Axios at the time . \"We probably tried 25 times.\"\nAsked about the importance of companies possibly being incentivized to bring back some of the nearly $3 trillion held overseas, Fink said, \"Bringing money back is to me is not that significant.\"\nMeanwhile, the U.S. corporate tax cut is a problem for Mexico because the rate is now lower in America, Fink said. Companies that had domiciled in Mexico for tax reasons are going to make their new tax homes in the U.S., he predicts.\nOn the markets, Fink said BlackRock is still \"quite bullish\" on stocks.\nThe BlackRock chairman and CEO also said retirement savers, even as old as 50 , should mostly be in stocks rather than bonds. That advice is counter to conventional asset allocation wisdom that long-term investors should have a portion of their portfolios in bonds.\nFink's comments came shortly after BlackRock reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, and said that assets under management exceeded $6 trillion.\nMorning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup Sign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.

That downsizing leaves unused footage, which Mansell said would benefit from traffic-generating retailers like those that sell food.\n\"If we had our preference, we are going first after well-capitalized companies, and preferably ones that have high traffic in grocery and convenience,\" Mansell said.\nThe Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based retailer has already identified \"a whole list of partners\" to roll out across a number of its stores.\n\"We are more apt to identify strong partners and then build a pathway with them through this pilot phase.\"\nFor potential Kohl's partners, the department store brings with it strong real estate, big parking lots and its own traffic. A food and apparel duo would be able to compete against a number of retailers employing similar strategies, like Target and even Walmart .\nNot all of Kohl's roughly 300 right-sized stores will necessarily lease space, at least at the onset. Kohl's may partner with several retailers in group rollouts and it could also partner with some as a one-off. Kohl's would consider partnerships with competitors, Mansell said.\nHe declined to say whether Whole Foods is one of its in-store partners. Kohl's already has a partnership with Whole Food's new owner, Amazon , through which it sells Amazon products and accepts its returns. \n\"It's not about Whole Foods, Aldi, or anybody else … we want a partner, ideally in food or convenience, to help drive traffic,\" said Mansell. The company plans to announce news about these efforts on its next earnings call, which is scheduled for March 1.\nRetailers are increasingly looking to unlikely bedfellows to broaden their offerings and rethink their store space. As in-store sales decline, smaller stores help retailers more profitably maintain their physical presence. Having stores helps with marketing and alleviating the cost of shipping and returns. Partners, meanwhile, can bring in new traffic.\nLord & Taylor-owner the Hudson's Bay Co. recently signed a deal with WeWork to lease some of its retail space to the office-sharing company.\nKohl's has said its smaller store concepts have allowed it to improve profitability and lower its inventory levels. The latter is important as it lessens the risk of unsold clothes, which hurt profit margins.\nLike its peers, it has also been opening stand-alone small-store concepts. This past quarter, it opened four new 35,000-square-foot stores, bringing the total up to 12. Target has plans to open 130 of its small-format stores by 2019 . European grocer Lidl, which is embarking on a U.S. expansion, recently shifted its focus to include smaller-format stores.\nBeyond focusing on improving the profitability of its store space, Kohl's has been focusing on other initiatives, which could include acquisitions, Mansell said. Potential deals are unlikely to include department store peers. \n\"Kohl's is not taking anything off the table.

But happiness expert and bestselling author Annie McKee wants people to escape this harmful cycle. \n\"If you have adopted that mindset that says, 'Work is grueling, just be happy you have a job, that you're getting a paycheck, it's a good company,' but you're not actually happy, you don't have to accept that,\" McKee tells CNBC Make It . \n\"Everyone deserves to be happy at work because if we're not happy at work, we're not happy in life,\" she adds. show chapters 11:05 AM ET Fri, 15 Dec 2017 | 01:04 \nAs a leadership adviser for Fortune 500 companies and governments around the world, McKee has spent decades researching effectiveness and happiness at work. She details portions of this research in her latest book: \" How to Be Happy at Work: The Power of Purpose, Hope, and Friendship .\" \n\"There are three ways to tell if things are not well,\" McKee says. \"There are physical clues that tell us something is wrong, emotional clues based on how we feel on a daily basis over time and clues from the health of our relationships.\" \nIf you have seen your unhappiness at work taking a toll on other areas of your life, such as your sleeping patterns, nutrition or family relationships, McKee recommends that you follow these two steps to regain a sense of purpose and happiness. Step one: Reflect \nOnce you understand you aren't happy at work, the first thing McKee recommends that you do is carve out some time for deep reflection and introspection. Ask yourself, \"What is causing me to feel sad or unhappy at work?\" \n\"It's far too easy to habitually tell yourself, 'I'm sad because don't like my manager' or 'I'm sad because didn't get promotion'\" McKee says. \"And while those things might be true, there's almost always something deeper than that.\" show chapters 1:00 PM ET Tue, 20 Dec 2016 | 01:25 \nMcKee further recommends that you be honest with yourself and ask if there is something about your own mindset and life that may be contributing to your unhappiness at work. \n\"Have you gotten trapped by overwork? Has your ambition gotten out of control? Have you chosen jobs and work projects because you think you should or because you actually want to?\" McKee says. \"Don't get caught in these traps.\" Step two: Find a friend \nWhether it's at work or outside of work, McKee suggests finding a friend to discuss this state of being with. \n\"Find someone who you can really talk with, who can really tell you the truth about what they see in you, whether it's the strengths or some developmental areas they see in you,\" McKee says. show chapters 12:22 PM ET Tue, 21 Nov 2017 | 00:59 \nYour friend can help you decide if you seem to fit in with your current workplace or if the job is not the right fit for you. \n\"Talking with a friend as if they were your [career] coach could also help you see your attitude about work from a different perspective,\" McKee says. \"And be open to all possibilities. Maybe you need to change your mindset, maybe you need to change what you do on a daily basis\" \n\"We have a lot more freedom than we like to think we do,\" she adds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T19:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T19:47:45.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Bezos's wealth surpassed Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates's previous record from 1999. \nBezos first overtook Gates as the richest man the world in October, when his net worth reached $93.8 million. \nA 31-year-old Gates became the youngest billionaire in the world in 1987, shortly after Microsoft went public. In 1995, at age 39, he was the richest man in the world with a fortune of $12.9 billion, NPR reports , and held the title on and off for decades. \nBut there's a simple reason Gates is no longer the richest person alive, and it's not because of Amazon's tremendous growth. Gates made the choice to give much of his money away. Chesnot | Getty Images \nIn 2000, the same year he stepped down as CEO of Microsoft, Gates co-founded the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation alongside his wife with the mission of improving the quality of life of people around the world. The couple pivoted to focus on philanthropy full time and have since donated $2.9 billion in cash and 700 million Microsoft shares to charitable causes, Bloomberg reports . \nThe pair plan give away the majority of their wealth throughout their lifetimes and are doing so by thoughtfully tackling major issues around the world. \nGates isn't just giving away his own fortune, either; he's inspiring others to do the same. In 2010, the Gateses teamed up with billionaire friend Warren Buffett to start The Giving Pledge, a movement for ultra-rich individuals to commit to donating at least half of their wealth to charitable causes during their lifetime. \nMore than 150 millionaires and billionaires have signed the pledge, including titans like Mark Zuckerberg, Richard Branson and Elon Musk. show chapters 10:21 AM ET Mon, 30 Oct 2017 | 01:16 \n\"We have committed the vast majority of our assets to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to help stop preventable deaths such as these, and to tear down other barriers to health and education that prevent people from making the very most of their lives,\" Gates wrote in his Giving Pledge letter . \"Our animating principle is that all lives have equal value.\" \nThe Foundation has already taken on a wide range of issues and projects, starting in 2000 with a $1 billion effort to send more than 20,000 kids to college . More recently, Bill and Melinda have committed millions to fighting Alzheimer's , providing resources to women in developing countries and promoting global health initiatives around the world , in addition to a variety of other causes . \nOne of the Foundation's proudest accomplishments is the work it has done to eradicate polio. It has contributed nearly $3 billion to help eliminate the disease by 2020 and Gates believes the last outbreak could be on the horizon. show chapters 4:42 PM ET Mon, 7 Aug 2017 | 00:54 \n\"Progress in fighting polio might be one of the world's best-kept secrets in global health,\" he acknowledged in the foundation's 2017 annual letter. But soon, he hopes, it will be a secret no more . \"If things stay stable in the conflicted areas, humanity will see its last case of polio this year.\" \nSince 2007, the Gates Foundation has contributed technical and financial resources to accelerate vaccination campaigns, provide routine immunization and polio surveillance partnerships as well as to help fund more effective vaccines. \nAnd the numbers show that its efforts have made a difference. In 1998, the polio virus was present in over 125 countries and paralyzed 350,000 people every year, mostly children. Since then, polio cases have been reduced by 99 percent, saving 13 million young children from paralysis. Today, there are only twelve known cases of the wild polio virus, according to Jay Wenger, who leads the Gates Foundation polio eradication efforts. Leigh Vogel | Getty Images Bill and Melinda Gates are presented with the 2016 Presidential Medal Of Freedom by President Obama at White House on November 22, 2016 in Washington, DC. \nHad Gates held onto the assets he's given to the foundation, he'd be worth an estimated $150 billion today, according to Bloomberg, which would give him the record. \nHe'd rather put that money to good use. \n\"We have been blessed with good fortune beyond our wildest expectations, and we are profoundly grateful,\" the Gateses wrote in their Giving Pledge letter. \"But just as these gifts are great, so we feel a great responsibility to use them well.\" \nBezos hasn't yet made a \"a major philanthropic mark,\" as Bloomberg puts it , but some predict that's in the cards for the billionaire. In June, Bezos put out a request for ideas on Twitter, where he said he was \"thinking about a philanthropy strategy.\" He followed up to say there's more to come, but he hasn't revealed what that will be. \nAlthough Bezos hasn't taken a deep dive into charitable giving just yet, he and his wife MacKenzie have made several sizable donations. He's partnered with Mary's Place , a local organization in Seattle to provide shelter for the homeless and gave $1 million of his personal funds.

Why in the world should I take a long or short position in something I don’t know about?”\nStill, while Buffett’s words often make waves in the stock market, cryptocurrency prices remained relatively stable following his comments. The Bitcoin price sank only slightly to about $14,400, while the price of Ethereum, the second most valuable cryptocurrency, rose to more than $1,300. Ripple, the third largest cryptocurrency by market cap, continued its multi-day slide, falling to less than $2 apiece amid concerns unrelated to Buffett’s comments.\nIt’s not the first time Buffett has dismissed cryptocurrencies. In 2014, the octogenarian investor dubbed Bitcoin a “mirage,” warning investors to “stay away from it.”\nThat sentiment echoes recent comments by other influential Wall Street figures including J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who in September called Bitcoin a “fraud. ”\nBut while Buffett said he wouldn’t go so far as shorting Bitcoin, he suggested he might find other ways to bet against it. The stock-picker told CNBC he’d “be glad” to buy five-year put options on “every one of the cryptocurrencies.” Put options can be a way for investors to bet against an asset, as they become more valuable as the underlying asset’s price falls.\nSuch put contracts give buyers the option to sell an asset at a certain price at a future date--which can result in a windfall if the price of the asset declines below the previously agreed-upon price. Put options, however, come with more limited risks than simply shorting an asset, which can result in infinite losses if the asset’s price rises instead of falling as expected.\nThough Buffett was speaking hypothetically and said he has not gone so far as to actually invest in any Bitcoin puts, there are now avenues for investors to pursue a similar bearish strategy. Derivatives exchange LedgerX, for one, offers both short- and long-term Bitcoin put options. But trading volumes have been relatively thin on the platform (just $1 million during its first week operating in October), making it less attractive for larger investors to get in the game.\nOn the other hand, there’s some reason investors might not want to take Buffett’s advice on Bitcoin. While the Oracle’s overall investing track record is unparalleled, Buffett has been notoriously reluctant to invest in new technology--a weakness that has cost him even better returns over time. At Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting last May, for example, Buffett expressed regret for not investing in Google (now known as Alphabet) googl and Amazon amzn stock years ago, having failed to appreciate the tech companies’ great potential.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T00:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T00:43:02.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Wheat dipped for the first time in three sessions as traders weighed up the prospect of a further drop in U.S. wheat sowings against stiff export competition in a well supplied global market. Corn was almost unchanged. Grain markets are bracing for crop reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday, with analysts notably expecting the USDA to boost U.S. soybean stocks after a record-large harvest and faltering exports. Investors were also awaiting weekly U.S. export sales data at 1330 GMT for an update on overseas demand. The Chicago Board Of Trade most-active soybean contract edged up a quarter of a cent to $9.55-1/4 a bushel by 1244 GMT. On Wednesday, prices hit their lowest since Dec. 22 at $9.51-3/4. \"U.S. soybean exports are surprisingly slow and I think it is because of quality issues,\" said one India-based agricultural commodities analyst at an international bank. \"It is difficult for U.S. soybean exports to recover now as Brazilian new-crop supplies will hit the market at the beginning of February.\" Brazilian soybean output is expected to reach 114 million tonnes in 2017/18, almost matching last year's record crop, consultancy AgRural said. CBOT wheat inched down 0.5 percent to $4.32-1/4 a bushel, consolidating after a near-one week high touched during the previous session. Corn ticked up 0.1 percent to $3.49-1/4 a bushel. Expectations that the USDA will peg U.S. winter wheat seedings below last season's level in its first estimate on Friday have lent some support to wheat prices following recent weather concerns in the U.S. Plains. However, weather risks were not seen as severe enough to shake up a global market with large inventories and strong export competition led by Russia. Farming agency FranceAgriMer lowered its forecast for French soft wheat exports outside the EU this season for a third straight month on Wednesday, predicting 9.3 million tonnes versus 9.5 million last month. \"This number looks optimistic considering the current pace of shipments and the large volumes exported by Russia, added to the high competitiveness of Argentinian origins,\" consultancy Agritel said in a note. \nPrices at 1244 GMT \nLast Chang Pct End Ytd Pct e Move 2017 Move CBOT wheat 432.25 -2.00 -0.46 427.00 1.23 CBOT corn 349.25 0.25 0.07 350.75 -0.43 CBOT soy 955.25 0.25 0.03 961.75 -0.68 Paris wheat Mar 161.00 0.00 0.00 159.00 1.26 Paris maize Mar 158.75 -0.50 -0.31 157.75 0.63 Paris rape Feb 354.50 -3.00 -0.84 347.75 1.94 WTI crude oil 63.93 0.36 0.57 60.42 5.81 Euro/dlr 1.20 0.00 0.42 \nMost active contracts - Wheat, corn and soy US cents/bushel, Paris futures in euros per tonne \n(Reporting by Naveen Thukral in Singapore and Gus Trompiz in Paris; editing by Richard Pullin and David Evans)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T15:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T21:24:30.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

But there are rising risks. To help investors negotiate the shifting investment landscape we offer our portfolio tips for the coming year:\nNavigating the end of easy money : The last quarter of 2018 will be the first time since the financial crisis when central banks are, in aggregate, withdrawing liquidity from global markets – the so-called end of easy money. The scale of the withdrawal is small relative to the stimulus, so we don't expect a hit to equity markets. But such policy turning points can see correlations rise in the movements of asset classes like equities and bonds, increasing portfolio volatility. Diversification into less-correlated alternatives, including hedge funds, could help.\nPosition for the return of active management : Market dynamics are starting to favor investors looking to take advantage of specific opportunities. Correlations between S&P 500 stocks recently fell to a 16-year low, meaning that stocks are increasingly being driven by their own fundamentals, rather than by moves in the overall market. The dispersion in valuation between the cheapest and most expensive stocks is also now well above its average since 1991, providing more opportunities for investors or managers seeking value in stocks.\nTurn off the 24 hour news: 2018 will bring more political flux, with March elections in Italy an early focal point. But investors should not get too caught up in the news cycle. In general, we believe that the impact of domestic politics on global markets is overestimated. While politics can have a negative effect on local markets, this can be mitigated by diversification. And the cost of being under invested over the long-term is much greater.\nRide the bumps: Over trading is another risk. Whether returns are positive or negative in the very short-term is largely down to chance. And our own analysis of mutual fund investors' buy and sell decisions indicates those who turned over their portfolios under performed by 0.9 percent annually compared with a buy and hold strategy, between April 2007 and March 2016.\nKeep some insurance: In our base case we don't expect flashpoints on the Korean Peninsula or in the Middle East to escalate to the extent that they disrupt markets. But it's worth holding at least some high-quality bonds in your portfolio, even if expected returns are low (or even negative in some currencies), just in case. They could prove a safe haven and help shield portfolios from losses. Exact percentage holdings will depend on individual investors' requirements, but they shouldn't be tempted to sell all high-quality bonds at this stage in favor of stocks.\nGet on the right side of technology: Tech firms accounted for 23 percent of S&P 500 earnings in the last reporting quarter, up by 5 percentage points in three years, and tech is now the largest sector in the MSCI Emerging Market and MSCI China indices. We see particular opportunities in digital data, automation and robotics, and smart mobility, which should benefit from secular trends such as population growth, aging, and urbanization. Meanwhile, avoiding the sectors at risk of disruption will be key. Recall that the entire US food retail sector fell by more than 10 percent in the week of Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods. The automotive and non-food retail sectors face particular risks.\nAvoid frenzies like cryptocurrencies: Getting on the right side of tech doesn't mean jumping into the latest investment mania. Bitcoin's 1600 percent price gain in 2017 was driven in part by FOMO, the fear of missing out on the next new thing. But it has all the hallmarks of a speculative bubble. Predicting the peak is difficult, but all bubbles tend to result in the same thing – a transfer of wealth from the many to the very fortunate few who got out at the right time.\nThink about sustainability: There is now strong evidence that incorporating social responsibility as part of the investment decision-making process does not sacrifice returns. Over the past 25 years the returns on the MSCI KLD 400 Social index has performed in line with the S&P 500, while Barclays MSCI Green Bond index has performed in line with the equivalent investment grade bond index since inception in 2013. So those making a New Year's Resolution to make a difference in 2018 can think about doing so with their portfolio, while still aiming for market returns.\nCommentary by Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management, overseeing the investment strategy for $2 trillion in invested assets.

But, according to one widely followed technician, the long boom could be heading for a bust.\nPiper Jaffray's Craig Johnson says bond yields are entering a \"danger zone\" as they approach 2.60 percent.\n\"When you've had these major inflection points in interest rates, they've corresponded pretty well with the starts and ends of secular bull and bear markets,\" he told CNBC's \" Trading Nation \" on Thursday. \"I have to question whether bond investors [and] central banks ... can make this smooth transition from a downward sloping interest rate environment to an upward sloping environment and not see this market stumble.\"\nBond prices and yields move inversely to each other.\nTake the bond market spook-out Wednesday when reports of China possibly curtailing its purchases of U.S. Treasurys sent bond yields sharply higher. The yield on the 10-year approached a 10-month high of just under 2.60 percent on Wednesday on those fears that China may pull back on its U.S. bond buying.\nAccording to Johnson's chart work, a break above 2.70 percent might unleash a torrent of selling for U.S. Treasurys.\nFederal Reserve members have expressed a willingness to raise the federal funds rate at least three times this year, moving off of the historically low levels of the financial crisis. Fed funds futures price in the hike in March, the second in June and a possible third in December – at a presumed steady increase of 25 basis points each time, the fed funds rate would then end the year at 2 percent to 2.25 percent. Bond prices typically fall when rates rise.\nRates around the world have been increasing on signs of a global recovery. Mark Tepper, president and CEO of Strategic Wealth Partners, says rising interest rates are a vote of confidence for the economy and should not meaningfully impact corporations' spending plans.\n\"If anything we would argue that a rising 10-year yield just indicates continued confidence in both the economy and corporate earnings and it should be good for stocks,\" he told CNBC. \"We're a firm believer that tax reform is going to stimulate capex and we don't think rising rates are going to prevent corporations from borrowing so they can fund their infrastructure investments.\"\nAlready, a string of corporations have announced changes resulting from the Republican tax reform bill passed in December. Walmart plans to raise its starting wage and offer paid parental and maternity leave, Wells Fargo upped its base wage, and AT&T and Bank of America announced bonuses for their workers.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

Nearly two weeks into the new year and energy has emerged as the best-performing sector. This as oil has surged to its highest level since December 2014.\nThere are two winners that could perform better than others this year, though, according to two market watchers.\nMark Tepper , president and CEO of Strategic Wealth Partners, says Chevron should lead the pack after keeping close control of its balance sheet last year. The energy company had positive excess cash flow for the first time since 2012, Tepper told CNBC's \" Trading Nation \" on Thursday.\n\"We think things are going to continue to get better in the future,\" said Tepper. \"They're making some big improvements on cost reduction and exiting some unprofitable markets.\"\nIt's not just Chevron, though — Tepper and his firm are bullish on energy as a whole. Their outlook sees an expanding global economy and higher capital expenditures and infrastructure spending fueling further gains for oil and the sector.\n\"All the fundamentals are good for the energy sector and with the rebound in oil prices we really expect this to be a bounce-back year for energy stocks,\" he said.\nThe charts back up Tepper's bullish case, according to Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Jaffray.\n\"We've got a little bit more to go in oil,\" said Johnson, appearing on \"Trading Nation.\" \"Get through $65 where you get a little bit of resistance, you're going to go to $70.\"\nFor his pick, Johnson names ConocoPhillips as the \"safe way for investors to play the energy trade\" right now. His technical analysis suggests a rise of at least 10 percent from current levels.\nA recovery in crude that gathered steam last year has found new momentum so far in 2018. Oil prices reached as high as $64.08 a barrel in intraday trade Thursday, its highest in more than three years, before paring gains to settle at $63.80. Crude has risen for the past four sessions in a row, supported by a drop in U.S. production and an eighth week of falling domestic stockpiles.\nThe Energy Select Sector ETF ( XLE ) rose 2 percent Thursday, its best one-day gain in three weeks, and is trading at its highest level since December 2016. The ETF's top three holdings – Exxon Mobil , Chevro, and Schlumberger — have had a rock-solid start to the year. Exxon is up nearly 4 percent since the beginning of 2018, Chevron more than 5 percent and Schlumberger 14 percent.\nDisclosure: Mark Tepper does not personally own CVX, but his firm does.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

Two government sources told Reuters they expected Trump to pull the plug at about the same time that negotiators from the United States, Canada and Mexico meet in late January for the sixth round of talks to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Mexico's peso reversed slight gains against the dollar after the report, and was trading down around 0.4 percent. The S&P/BM IPC stock index was down about 1.8 percent, heading for its biggest loss since Oct. 25. Trump has repeatedly threatened to walk away from NAFTA, a lynchpin of the Mexican economy, unless Canada and Mexico agree to major changes Washington claims are needed to make the 1994 pact more fair to U.S. workers and businesses. Yields on short-term Brazilian interest rate futures inched up on Wednesday as higher-than-expected inflation data for 2017 drove traders to trim bets on two additional interest rate cuts. Price pressures have been muted for months in Brazil, curbed growth. That may allow the central bank to keep rates at all-time lows for a long time, bolstering the economy's recovery. The benchmark Bovespa stock index fell 0.84 percent, extending losses for a second day as traders booked profits from a rally early in the year that took it to all-time highs. \nKey Latin American stock indexes and currencies at 20:47 GMT: \nStock indexes daily % YTD % Latest change change MSCI Emerging Markets 1197.84 -0.61 4.03 MSCI LatAm 2931.06 -0.76 4.43 Brazil Bovespa 78200.57 -0.84 2.35 Mexico IPC 48817.09 -1.78 -1.09 Chile IPSA 5678.09 -0.56 2.04 Chile IGPA 28570.82 -0.52 2.11 Argentina MerVal 31618.65 -1.62 5.17 Colombia IGBC 11807.49 -0.64 3.84 Venezuela IBC 1327.47 1.98 -95.81 Currencies daily % YTD % change change \nLatest \nBrazil real 3.2280 -0.02 2.64 Mexico peso 19.3000 -0.33 2.07 Chile peso 608.37 -0.06 1.03 Colombia peso 2888.5 0.67 3.24 Peru sol 3.222 -0.12 0.47 Argentina peso (interbank) 18.6100 1.91 -0.05 Argentina peso (parallel) 19.27 1.40 -0.21 \n(Reporting by Bruno Federowski in Sao Paulo & Anthony Esopsito in Mexico City; Editing by Paul Simao and Meredith Mazzilli)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T23:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T05:41:35.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Most of its assets, including its sister pages Deadspin, a sports site, and Jezebel, a feminist blog, were bought in 2016 for $135 million by media company Univision Holdings Inc . \nThiel has not said why he wants Gawker, though the potential acquisition would let him take down stories regarding his personal life that are still available on the website, and remove the scope for further litigation between him and Gawker. Thiel, who is Facebook Inc's first major investor and a co-founder of payment service PayPal Inc, did not respond to a request for comment. \nGawker's bankruptcy plan administrator Will Holden, of consulting firm Dacarba LLC, and the website's bankruptcy attorney Gregg Galardi, of law firm Ropes & Gray LLP, have tried to block Thiel's bid, according to court papers. \nGalardi in late November asked a U.S. bankruptcy court judge to deny Thiel's request to bid, according to court papers. He also argued Thiel is \"not a 'proper' purchaser\" because he could end up as the target of litigation, according to court papers. \nThiel funded former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker after the site published a sex tape featuring Hogan. The former wrestler, whose real name is Terry Bollea, won a $140 million judgment against the site, and later settled for $31 million. \nGawker in 2007 published a story about Thiel's homosexuality. \nMultiple bidders have submitted offers for the site, Holden said in a phone interview on Thursday. Holden will choose a winner as soon as this month, and then request approval for the deal from a U.S. bankruptcy court judge, the sources said. If Holden excludes Thiel's bid, Thiel could ask the judge to consider it if it is higher than rival offers. \nThe value of Thiel's bid could not be learned, though the sources said Gawker is only now worth a few million dollars. \nKevin Lee, the co-founder and executive chairman of Didit, a marketing firm, said he also submitted a bid, without disclosing its value. If successful, Lee said, he plans to use the site to raise money for readers' preferred charities. \nThe terms of the Univision sale restrict new articles from being published on Gawker until March 9. \nA group of former Gawker employees this week abandoned their effort to bid, one of the sources said. They had launched a campaign seeking $500,000 in donations through fundraising site Kickstarter, but failed to reach their goal and have returned the approximately $90,000 they did collect.

The consultancy in November forecast a 111 million tonne harvest. \nThe big Brazilian crop was likely to dominate global export trade markets in the months to come, stealing away market share from U.S. soy exporters. \n\"It is difficult for U.S. soybean exports to recover now as Brazilian new-crop supplies will hit the market at the beginning of February,\" said one India-based agricultural commodities analyst at an international bank. \nWeekly U.S. soybean export sales of 607,400 tonnes and corn sales of 437,800 tonnes were both within analyst estimates. \nBut U.S. wheat exports dropped to 71,500 tonnes, a marketing-season low and below estimates for 250,000 to 450,000 tonnes. \nCBOT March wheat eased to a session low of $4.28-1/4 per bushel in the wake of the export data before paring losses to $4.33-1/2, down 3/4 cent. \nCBOT March corn was down 1/4 cent to $3.48-1/4.

Venturing into space has been a longtime dream of Branson's and with a recent announcement from Virgin Galactic, Branson is approaching his goal.\nOn Thursday, the commercial spaceflight company tweeted that the company had successfully launched a spaceship flight test.\nTWEET \nTWEET 2 \nThe flight test marks the 11th flight for VSS Unity and the 242nd for VMS Eve, according to the company's Twitter feed. This was also the first flight since an August glide test.\nBranson expressed his own excitement for Virgin Galactic's most recent accomplishment, noting that this will hopefully be their final glide test.\nTWEET \nThough Branson has discussed his space goals at length , the serial entrepreneur admits that he still can't believe that it's actually coming to fruition. In his blog post, Branson writes that when he first founded Virgin, he never imagined that he'd be going into space.\n\"I still pinch myself to think of how far we've come,\" he writes.\nThe tech entrepreneur has been gearing up for his eventual space travel by focusing on his fitness. Branson has previously touted the importance of exercise and generally keeps active. However, there are different demands on the body when entering space.\nAccording to NASA , muscles atrophy quickly because of the lack of gravity in space. Astronauts on the International Space Station spend two and a half hours per day working, in order to combat this issue.\nBranson isn't the only person preparing for space travel in the very near future. Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides told CNBC last March that more than 600 people have signed up for the $250,000 ticket aboard the spaceship.\nVenture firms are also seeing space travel as a viable business : Last October, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia invested $1 billion into Branson's three space companies: Virgin Galactic, The Spaceship Company and Virgin Orbit.\nWith a second test under his belt, Branson is now closer to his 2018 goal for Virgin Galactic. In fact, it was just last October that the self-made billionaire said that he expects to be in space by April 2018. \"I would be very disappointed if I haven't been into space within six months or so,\" he told CNBC's Squawk Box at the time.\nBut the rapid pace of entrepreneurial success doesn't elude him. In his most recent blog post, Branson says that he enjoys seeing how quickly businesses can grow and thrive in such a short span of time.\n\"It really reinforces how anything is possible if you surround yourself with the best team of motivated people who want to bring out the best in others and strive to do better for their customers.\"\nLike this story?

The double-edged news embodied the increasingly evident reality of the tax bill for retail: More money doesn't change the situation of a store that isn't working.\nExecutives have been expressing optimism due to potential tax savings, but skepticism that the cash will save the industry was evident at the ICR retail conference in Orlando this week. The sentiment there about the retail industry could be summed up as: better, but not great.\nInvestors and advisors at ICR said they don't believe lower corporate taxes will have any long-term substantive impact on business models that are not working. They believe it may help the stronger transform faster, but they say it will not save those that are too far behind.\nThere are still too many stores and structural challenges in certain areas — apparel brands reliant on malls, department stores with more space than they need — that short-term windfalls are unlikely to address. Walmart closed Sam's Clubs locations Thursday because those stores were not making enough money and the retailer is investing in e-commerce.\nCompanies best positioned to take advantage of tax savings are those that have already invested in technology or transformation. Kroger and Walmart have both poured money into cashier-free capabilities. Additionally, Kohl's is considering introducing grocery stores into its retail locations as a way to drive traffic, CNBC reported this week.\nFor others, it may be too late.\nSeveral retail advisors told CNBC they expect much of the money from tax reform to be given back to shareholders, who are eager to take their money out of the industry altogether.\nThere were bright spots at the conference, too. Investors were excited about industries they view as Amazon-resistant: auto, anything in services and home.\nFlooring company Floor & Decor and home goods company At Home are both names identified as having performed strongly despite general retail challenges. Intriguingly, they are two of the few retail companies to go public over the last year, and both lack an e-commerce business.\nIndustry sources remained cautious about the number of retail IPOs that may be coming in the year ahead.

But some economists think the economy is at or near full employment and worry about a possibility of overheating growth. \nEarlier on Friday , Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan told CNBC, \"We're going to overshoot full employment.\" \n\"The history of overshooting full employment in this country has not been a happy one,\" leading to an \"overheating\" and the Fed playing catch up, Kaplan said. \"What happens then is you tend to often have a recession.\" \nMeanwhile, Kroszner also sees the low volatility in the markets as possibly troublesome. \nThere should be at least average volatility \"given all the geopolitical risks, given a lot of uncertainty with respect to policies,\" said Kroszner, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago. But so-called synchronized global growth, which he said is rare, is contributing to the steady growth and confidence levels. \nKroszner said the new Republican tax overhaul, which President Donald Trump signed into law last month, is a positive sign both short- and long-term. \n\"We've had a very slow investment recovery,\" he said. \"If you have better investment incentives and investment-friendly regulatory environment, you're likely to get more investment, which will lead to higher productivity, and that increases long-run growth.\" \n\"This is a very goofy time in the economy cycle to be trying to spur the economy with that type of stimulus with the [low] unemployment rate,\" Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, told CNBC on Friday. \"Firms are having a hard time finding people.

It sells ads and promotes content from some publishers, which means it stands to make cash off of the most popular news stories ... no matter how accurate they are.\nSadly, that has led news organizations to use Facebook as a means to drive traffic, but not to create an established audience.\nThe Verge's Casey Newton hit the nail right on the head:\nread tweet \nOr this one, from The Information's Jessica Lessin, nails it again:\ntweet \nI remember, for example, that there used to be an easy way to game Facebook traffic to a news site simply by writing about any of the trending stories posted on the news feed. It drove crazy amounts of people to blogs and other organizations, but never people who came back.\nAnd as for the fake news problem, Facebook even admits that earlier attempts to stop it from spreading actually did the exact opposite. In a blog post last month, Facebook product manager Tessa Lyons said that red flags that it posted next to stories that were meant to identify false news were actually doing the opposite.\n\"Academic research on correcting misinformation has shown that putting a strong image, like a red flag, next to an article may actually entrench deeply held beliefs – the opposite effect to what we intended,\" Lyons said. \nYikes.\nFacebook has forced the hands of some news organizations to change for the worse — pivoting to sometimes short but often unimportant videos about cats in pajamas instead of real topics, like what's on the front page of The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNBC, Bloomberg and other established first-rate news organizations.\nMake no mistake: It would have devastating effects on sites that rely on Facebook for traffic and revenue. It'll also force publishers to get back to what we do best — what we're supposed to be doing in the first place — reporting first and generating traffic second (we do need to pay the bills after all, right?). It'll create new traffic that accumulates through an audience who wants to return because they expect high quality content. (Obviously, Facebook can't stop users from sharing news articles in their feeds.)\nOtherwise we face another problem: The possibility of requiring some sort of government regulation of Facebook's news feed. That would help cut down on propaganda and fake news, but it also sets a dangerous precedent where the government might one day be able to regulate more of the news media, whether it's on Facebook or other platforms.\nFacebook says it's moving away from news, and that's a step, but it's time for it to shut down the news operation entirely.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T21:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T21:30:43.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

(Reuters) - Rescue crews expanded their search on Friday for at least five people missing after mudslides in southern California that killed at least 17 people, damaged hundreds of buildings and caked highways with sludge. \nAbout 1,250 emergency workers raced against the clock to find survivors with drones, heavy equipment and sniffer dogs in the rescue and clean-up efforts, the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services said. \n“We’ve got a window that’s closing but we’re still very optimistic we’ve got some time. There’s been plenty of cases where they’ve found people a week after,” Santa Barbara County Fire Department spokesman Mike Eliason said on a muddy Montecito street that was especially hard hit by the mudslide. \nIn Santa Barbara County, it has been at least two days since anyone was rescued alive, Eliason said. Most rescues were on Tuesday. \nThe number of missing has fluctuated as people were located, said the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office. Authorities said on Thursday night that 43 people were not accounted for. \nResidents in some areas were subject to a new mandatory evacuation on Friday, emergency officials said, adding that the unstable environment remained a threat to residents and emergency responders. \nTriggered by heavy rains, the massive slides struck before dawn on Tuesday. Walls of mud and debris cascaded down hillsides stripped of trees and shrubs last month by wildfires, including the Thomas Fire, the largest blaze in the state’s history. EXHAUSTED CREWS \nExcavators carrying rescuers in their buckets plowed through mud-coated roads in search of the missing after some areas were buried in as much as 15 feet (4.6 m) of mud, emergency officials said. \n“It is heavy. It’s wet. It just exhausts the crews out there,” Sacramento Fire Department Captain Pat Costamagna said in a social media video from the governor’s emergency management office.

REUTERS/ Kyle Grillot \nCounty officials have already ordered residents in most of the southeastern corner of Montecito, an unincorporated community east of the city of Santa Barbara, to leave their homes for what they said was likely to be one or two weeks to aid the search and recovery efforts. \nIn one of the worst-hit areas of Montecito, mud blew through doors and windows, filling the interiors of houses with muck and debris. The walls at one end of a home had disappeared, leaving its roof hanging precariously. \nDowned power lines wrapped around trees at one property, while elsewhere the lines dropped almost to the ground. Elsewhere, cars were perched on mounds of earth and garage doors had caved in. \nThe area, northwest of Los Angeles, is home to many celebrities and other wealthy Californians who relish the seclusion and relative proximity to the city. Slideshow (9 Images) \nThe cause of death for all 17 victims will be listed as multiple traumatic injuries resulting from flash floods with mudslides, the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s office said Thursday. The dead ranged in age from 3 to 89. \nEight Cal Fire workers in yellow jackets picked through debris with shovels and axes on a tree-lined residential street in Montecito, searching for vehicles swept away in the mudslides. \n“They’re all pretty trashed in the mud,” said Cal Fire Captain Mitch Colombo, facing a pair of vehicles resting at odd angles on a floe of muck in front of a residential gate. \nOne of California’s most celebrated roads, coastal Highway 101, was closed in parts of Santa Barbara County where mud was 2 feet deep in parts. \nResidents of the mudslide-hit area were assessing their damaged homes, with some grateful their properties had survived. \n“We have a yard to redo and hopefully our insurance will help out with that, but the people across from me, newer homes, gone,” said Garrett Speirs, a 54-year-old artist who has been living in Montecito for 20 years. \n“Everybody down below gone, two girls gone,” Speirs said. “Two sixth graders in the school our kids went to.” Additional reporting by Keith Coffman in Denver, Chris Kenning in Chicago, Gina Cherelus and Peter Szekely in New York and Jon Herskovitz in Austin, Texas; Writing by Scott Malone and Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and James Dalgleish", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T12:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T13:31:59.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Basically, these are legal agreements that permanently limit the use of designated land for preservation purposes. The owner continues to control the property, while a limited-time tax deduction is generated based on the value of the land had it been developed. Generally, the limits on the land continue, even it is passed on to heirs or sold .\nHigh-profile deals involving notable figures including President Donald Trump have brought attention to these types of structures.\nTrump, for example, created a preservation easement on his Mar-a-Lago estate in 1993. The property was reportedly appraised at $25 million at that time. An easement that prevented him from selling antiques inside the historic building or adding more buildings to the compound reduced the valuation to $19.25 million. Trump was able to take a tax deduction for the difference — $5.75 million — once the easement was established.\nThe president has reportedly generated more than $100 million in write offs through easement deals, including a $39 million deduction on his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf course.\nDavidoff Studios | Getty Images View towards the pool and spa of the Mar-a-Lago estate, Palm Beach, Florida, February 13, 2017. Investors looking to cash in on this type of deal have turned to syndicated conservation easements, whereby multiple investors participate. They have become a popular way to pursue this tax deduction. These private placements, as they are known, are often opaque transactions, open only to certain high net-worth investors.\nThe IRS, however, has warned that it is looking at these arrangements, particularly where deductions \"significantly exceed the amount invested.\"\nIn December 2016, the agency put out a notice that characterized syndicated conservation easements as \"listed transactions,\" defining them as potential tax avoidance strategies. While avoiding taxes is not as severe as tax evasion in the eyes of the IRS, it can still draw penalties and fines.\nThe labeling of listed status on a transaction by the IRS , however, does not happen frequently, according to the agency. A listed transaction requires additional disclosures to be filed with the IRS. And while the agency does have other disclosure requirements, listing is considered the most serious.\nLast July, then-IRS Commissioner John A. Koskinen wrote to one Senate Finance Committee member that an initial analysis of the disclosures the agency had received showed an average deduction of nine times the initial investment. By that measure, an investor who put in $500,000, for example, would be claiming a $4.5 million deduction.\nTotal deductions nationwide for conservation easements reached $3.2 billion in 2014, up from $1.1 billion in 2013 and $971 million in 2012, according to a 2017 Brookings Institution report .\nDespite the scrutiny, some financial advisors maintain there are quality deals they are finding for their clients. Critics of the transactions say the conservation benefits are limited.\nInvestment opportunity A syndicated conservation easement transaction can be used to offset up to 50 percent of an investor's adjusted gross income in a tax year. The IRS does allow you to carry over contributions that exceed your adjusted gross income. For a qualified conservation transaction, the time limit on those carry-overs is 15 years.\nThe potential tax benefits of these deals has led some financial advisors to pursue these investments on behalf of clients. Certain characteristics need to be in place when sourcing these private transactions — such as top-notch legal and accounting teams.\n\"This, in my opinion, is too sophisticated for a lay person to go into\" without the help of a financial advisor, said Matt Chancey, an investment advisor in Orlando, Florida.\nGetty Images A man practices on the putting green in Bedminster Township, New Jersey. Certified financial planner Larry Breen, founder of Breen Financial Management in Lake Mary, Florida, said there are several requirements that should be in place for it to be worthwhile.\nFirst, while most deals stipulate that participants be accredited investors, who by regulators' definition earn at least $200,000 per year, or $300,000 if they are married, the ideal participant will earn more than $500,000, according to Breen. They also must have clean tax records, he said, because these kinds of deals can draw IRS scrutiny. The offerings are often structured through LLCs, further masking the true owners.\nInvestors also need savvy tax advisors. Both the investor and their advisors need to understand and be comfortable with the tax, legal and property appraisers involved in the deal, Breen said.\nPeople who put their money in these deals also need to know that the syndicated conservation easement will be most likely be audited by the IRS, and they also could be audited individually.\nThe best deals, according to Breen, will include a memorandum that discloses all of the risks involved in the \"private placement,\" a type of non-public sale of securities available to a limited number of investors.\n\"The thing should read like a Stephen King horror novel,\" he said.\nFrom there, the investor has to decide which motivates them more: the risks or rewards tied to the investment.\nThe appraisal of the land is also a crucial part of the deal. Investors want to make sure they have a top-caliber appraiser who applies best practices, according to Breen.\n\"That's the first thing that the IRS is going to challenge,\" he said.\nshow chapters How to avoid a tax audit 5:52 AM ET Mon, 4 April 2016 | 02:26 The conservation benefits should also be a strong driver for making the investment, according to Breen.\n\"There's a lot of people who do care about the future of the planet and want to make sure habitat is set aside so that we stay a biologically diverse planet,\" Breen said.\nBesides the tax break, investors can also benefit from any revenue that comes from the property, Chancey said.\nFor example, a 100-acre property could be divided so that 90 acres is conserved, while 10 acres is devoted to a golf course, Chancey said. Or the whole property could be conserved, while revenue could be generated from licensing or using the property, such as for hunting and fishing.\nBut the revenue component is ancillary, Chancey said.\n\"No one who gets into an easement is expecting to generate revenue from it,\" Chancey said. \"Some of the deals just happen to have a revenue component.\"\n\"There's a lot of people who do care about the future of the planet and want to make sure habitat is set aside so that we stay a biologically diverse planet.\" -Larry Breen, Breen Financial Management The Partnership for Conservation, an advocacy group, argues that current tax incentives have resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of acres conserved.\n\"Land conservation is both a necessary goal and an expensive proposition that cannot fall solely on federal, state and local governments,\" a spokesman for the organization said.\nDeal critics Opponents say the cost to the U.S.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T15:59:57.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Check Point dubbed the malware \"AdultSwine,\" and soon after the security firm alerted Google to the problem, the apps disappeared from the Play store. \n\"We have a good working relationship with Google's security team,\" Daniel Padon, a Check Point researcher, tells CNBC. \nHowever, even after Google deleted the apps from Play, the malware will continue to live on in people's phones until they get rid of it. \n\"We've removed the apps from Play, disabled the developers' accounts, and will continue to show strong warnings to anyone that has installed them,\" a Google spokesperson says. \"We appreciate Check Point's work to help keep users safe.\" \nOnce a person downloaded one of the infected apps, pop-ups would either alert them that they had a virus and direct them to a fake security app, convince them to enter their phone number through a contest to win an iPhone, or show them pornographic content. The latter is particularly disturbing considering that most of these infected apps were games or drawing tutorials intended to entice kids. \nAlthough the apps would likely be most appealing to kids, Google says that they wouldn't have appeared in what Play calls its Designed for Families section, where it recommends safe, appropriate ads for children. However, the search giant did come under fire earlier this year when YouTube, its video site, allowed disturbing videos to infiltrate its official feeds for children . \nAlthough Google actively scans the Play store for malicious code, policing its vast, ever-evolving catalog of apps is a challenge. \nThe company is \"struggling to keep certain malware outside the App store\" because some nasty code can only be detected by dynamically analyzing the context of an app's actions, which is hard to do, a Check Point researcher explains. \n\"'AdultSwine' and other similar malware will likely be continually repeated and imitated by hackers,\" Check Point says. \"Users should be extra vigilant when installing apps, particularly those intended for use by children.\" Jillian D'Onfro Technology Reporter for CNBC.com Related Securities", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T16:09:05.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Of course, not all of them will form the basis of products, but Amazon has had some very notable patents -- like one-click shopping and many of the technologies that make up the foundation of cloud computing, now its most profitable business. \nSo we looked at some recent patent issues to get into the head of Bezos -- and see if we could find some clues about the inventions and technologies Amazon might be looking at next. \nWith the help of MCAM, a analytics firm that measures companies intellectual property we looked at a few patents issued over the last month. Some of them could be straight out of Black Mirror, the Netflix series that explores a high-tech near future. And when you look at activity overall, some themes emerge. MCAM analysis reveals that Amazon is ramping up patent activity in video, connected home and AR technologies. Augmented reality mirror \nIn December, Amazon was issued patents that include an augmented reality mirror and a \"smart\" sensor-studded package delivery air vehicle, as well as patents that include technology that would \"mute\" the Echo's video mode by pixelization for user privacy and detect hacked self driving cars. \nAs Amazon moves deeper into the fashion world, an augmented reality mirror would bring that world into customers' homes. It allows users to try on virtual clothes in a virtual setting, using a system of cameras, mirrors, projectors and lights to project different backgrounds and clothes onto the user. \nAmazon's Echo Look camera is already halfway there -- letting users take a picture with the help of Amazon's Alexa AI voice assistant, and use that to virtually try on different outfits. The company may be looking for ways to blend the Echo Look technology with its other recent fashion forays, like its own clothing, handbag and shoe labels and its Stitch Fix-like at-home clothing trial service. \nAlso in December, Amazon filed a patent for technology that would detect hacked self-driving cars. While Amazon has never said they are getting into autonomous driving, the patent could be hugely important for bigger players in this space like Tesla, Alphabet and Uber. \nAnother notable patent issued in the last month could advance video technology in Amazon's Echo devices. The technology allows users to use video conferencing on their Echo and mute it by blurring or pixelating the video for user privacy. This one suggests that Amazon is thinking of privacy protections as it ramps up video communication. A strong history of patents \nWhile many of Amazon's thousands of patents may never come to fruition, experts say that Amazon has very notable successes in terms of developing and protecting core patented technology. \nFor example, long before cloud computing was a mainstream enterprise practice -- and long before Google or Microsoft entered the space -- Amazon was getting patents issued relating to advanced cloud management and deployment. \n\"That strategy very much empowered their business strategy to allow them to have a huge lead in cloud,\" says David Pratt, Managing Director at MCAM. \"In turn,\" he says, \"it made it more complex and costly for competitors to stand up their cloud capability.\" Amazon's cloud unit, AWS, is now the company's most profitable business. \nAmazon's patent for one-click shopping, which lets customers buy things without entering and re-entering their billing, payment or shipping information, was issued in 1999. That patent gave it an edge over other retailers and reaped dividends through licensing fees from the likes of Apple and others. It expired last year, but for nearly 20 years, Amazon was the only game in town for a technology many consumers now take for granted. \nGaston Kroub, a founding partner at IP litigation boutique Kroub, Silbersher & Kolmykov, says that Amazon \"struck gold\" with one-click by getting a seminal ecommerce patent. With cloud computing, he says Amazon got in early \"in what proved to be a very important business unit and that gave them a competitive advantage. \nTo date Amazon has over 6,100 patents issued by the U.S., Europe and World Intellectual Property Organization. But in the business of patents, experts say it's not about numbers, but having the best quality patents that aim to enable and extend a company's business model. And in that regard, Pratt says, Amazon has one of the richest patent portfolios among the Fortune 500. \nKroub says that while Bezos has been proactive and smart about getting patents, part of his success comes from the era in which the company grew up. \n\"It helped that Amazon came of age at a time when there was a real land rush to patent technologies around software and business practices,\" Kroub says. \"During the dotcom boom, there was a huge rush in the patent office to grab as many as possible. Amazon was part of that wave and developed good habits on the patent front.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T21:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T22:13:22.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Darrell Issa said he won't seek re-election to a 10th term representing his San Diego-area district . On Monday, his California colleague Ed Royce said he will decline to seek a 14th term in his district outside Los Angeles. \nThat makes 30 Republicans so far who plan to leave the House by year-end, either to retire or seek higher office. That's twice the number of departing House Democrats — presenting a major opportunity for a minority party that needs 24 more seats to snatch back the speaker's gavel for Nancy Pelosi . \nThe Republican exodus stems in part from historical patterns. The party holding the White House nearly always loses seats in midterm elections. \nIt has been propelled further by the bombastic and divisive White House debut of President Donald Trump , who is the least-popular new president in the history of polling. Presidential popularity is a leading indicator of midterm election results. \nThe trend has received yet more fuel from the nature of the Republican agenda. Trump's pursuit of a wall on the Mexican border has heightened political dangers for Republicans in districts with Hispanic constituencies, as the tax-cut bill has done for those representing areas hard-hit by the reduction of state and local tax deductions. \nRoyce and Issa represent prime examples of Republican incumbents in the line of fire. So do other moderate-minded Republican retirees such as Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey and Dave Reichert of Washington state. \nTo a lesser degree, the current climate has opened fresh opportunities for Democrats to recapture the Senate, as well. With Democrats needing just two more seats to make Charles Schumer of New York the majority leader, GOP Sens. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee have stepped away from the fight. \nNone of this guarantees a Democratic-controlled House or Senate in 2019. Democrats have many more Senate seats to defend in November. \nRepublicans in both chambers benefit from a strong economy and surging financial markets. The lopsided partisan balance in most congressional districts makes it difficult to knock off the majority of GOP incumbents who are seeking new terms. \nOne signal both parties will watch closely is the decision of House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Some of his friends expect him friends to join the exodus himself after winning enactment of his cherished tax cut last month. \nRyan's spokeswoman said recently that \"he's not going anywhere anytime soon.\" There remain 10 months until Election Day.

After reporting the incident to her boss, the lawsuit alleged, she missed out on pay and promotions while her accused attacker steadily rose through the ranks.\nCathy Sellars, a 59-year-old mother of two adult children, was training to become a truck driver for freight hauler CRST when she complained to her bosses about repeated sexual harassment by male colleagues, according to a class action lawsuit against the company. Her complaints ignored, she says in court records, she eventually found herself in a truck cab with a male driver who pulled a knife on her after she rebuffed his sexual advances. He then refused to allow her to exit the truck during a trip through the southwest and held her for several hours, she said.\nAnd Sebastian Kelly, a gay driver for an ambulance company in Alabama, said in a lawsuit that he worked in a sexually charged atmosphere, where two male co-workers routinely exposed their genitalia.\nNews headlines of late have focused on sexual harassment accusations against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, former Today show anchor Matt Lauer, former U.S. Senator Al Franken and other media figures, entertainers and politicians. In each case, the accusers say they waited years to confront the men who accosted them, most of them too ashamed or fearful to complain publicly or persuaded to keep quiet by tactics meant to suppress the truth.\nBut these three plaintiffs, and many like them, chose to confront their alleged abusers and hold the companies they work for accountable in public court. Rather than opening the incidents to full public scrutiny, however, judges let companies push the legal boundaries of what should be considered confidential and to keep details of abusive behavior secret.\nA Reuters review of federal court cases filed between 2006 and 2016 revealed hundreds containing sexual harassment allegations where companies used common civil litigation tactics to keep potentially damning information under wraps. Plaintiffs in some cases say companies sought to conceal internal documents that reveal similar harassment claims, as well as corporate policies that favored abusers over victims.\nIn one case, plaintiff lawyers collected secret evidence about alleged criminal behavior, including details of a pharmaceutical saleswoman who alleged a doctor sexually assaulted her at a work-related event. Her supervisor admitted to giving a sheriff’s detective false information about the allegations, court records show.\nTHE COST OF SECRECY The true number of such cases is likely much greater than the hundreds identified by Reuters. Federal courts categorize sexual harassment within a larger group of gender discrimination claims, which makes a full accounting difficult. In addition, many sexual harassment cases are filed in state courts. Reuters focused its review on the federal courts because records are more accessible and consistent.\nAs a result of the sealed documents, cases that could shine light on specific abusers, or on toxic corporate cultures, do the opposite: They enable the very secrecy and corporate complicity that allow sexual harassment to persist in the workplace.\nShira Scheindlin, a former Manhattan federal judge, said judges should make public human-resources complaints that result in employee discipline.\n“Otherwise, you get the serial abuser just doing it at the next job,” said Scheindlin, who currently heads the American Bar Association’s federal courts subcommittee and whose private practice includes advising companies on handling sexual harassment complaints. “If that record had been available, there would have been no next job.”\nU.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said courts are going too far in routinely sealing such cases. Documents filed in federal court are presumed to be public, he said, so people can understand how the judiciary works. Companies should not be allowed to cloak evidence just because it is damaging, said the judge, based in San Francisco. That goes not only for sexual harassment but also for broader corporate governance issues.\n“It’s hard to see why their private interests to avoid embarrassment trumps the public’s right to have access to litigation,” Breyer said.\nCompanies say they have good reason to seek broad protective orders. They frequently argue that their internal documents contain unproven allegations that shouldn’t be public, or sensitive business information that could aid a competitor. Plaintiff attorneys say they often agree to protective orders and motions to seal information from public disclosure because fighting over public access can increase the length and cost of a lawsuit.\nMany judges, meanwhile, are reluctant to enforce transparency when neither side has requested it, according to several current and former federal judges.\n“I don’t think any judge is presumptively hostile to the idea of disclosure,” Breyer said. “We may be presumptively hostile to doing more work. I’m speaking for myself.”\nMost civil cases settle before they can be publicly aired before a jury. That means the pre-trial secrecy allows companies to permanently conceal information about their sexual harassment policies and how they respond to specific complaints of abuse.\nA broad protective order in the ongoing lawsuit by Chen-Oster and three other women against Goldman has allowed the Wall Street giant to keep hundreds of documents under wraps for three years.\nAsked about the secrecy, a Goldman spokesperson told Reuters the firm keeps details private because it promises employees confidentiality when they report concerns. The spokesperson would not discuss the specific allegations raised by Chen-Oster and the other plaintiffs.\nIn court documents, the company acknowledges that Chen-Oster told her boss about the contact with her co-worker and that the supervisor contacted Goldman’s human resources department about it. Chen-Oster, the company says in court filings, did not want to pursue a human resources complaint.\nThe protective order permitted lawyers on either side to mark any document exchanged in discovery as confidential, thus barring anyone from disclosing it outside the case. Such orders have become standard to ensure secrecy during the pre-trial evidence discovery phase in U.S. civil litigation.\nThere are no nationwide standards on what information should be sealed when discovery documents are later filed in court. Several federal appeals courts recognize that trade secrets, sensitive financial data, or personal information like Social Security Numbers can remain secret. When it comes to allegations of misconduct, some case law allows information that would intrude on an individual’s privacy to be kept secret. But it is left to judges to decide if someone’s privacy outweighs the public’s interest in disclosure.\nInitially, Chen-Oster’s lawyers agreed to the protective order, but later, when they sought to broaden the case, they took the rare step of arguing that many documents filed in court should be made public.\nAdam Klein, one of her lawyers, said plaintiff", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T18:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T18:59:42.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Consumer Cramer has already spoken about how the consumer is stronger than many people think. But recently, only do-it-yourself and bargain retailers like Home Depot and Costco were considered to be stable investments by Wall Street.\n\"After this week, it's clear that we're getting terrific results from all kinds of retailers,\" Cramer said. \"The numbers are so big that you have to think there's been a serious pickup in shopping, not just back to where we were in 2014, but, in many cases, to where we were in the early-to-mid-2000s.\"\nStill, Cramer warned investors not to jump the gun. Because the VanEck Vectors Retail ETF is largely in control of the sector, the best strategy would be to wait for it to pull back before buying the improving retail names, he said.\n\"Given that the RTH has been roaring lately, I think you'll end up overpaying if you don't wait for a little bit of a downturn,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"But in truth, retail executives feel that job creation [and] stability, coupled with some genuine economic booms often related to cheap energy in the Southeast, are all combining to create a much more positive backdrop.\"\n2. Millennials Household formation , particularly by millennials starting families, is also having an unexpectedly positive effect on the retail sector, Cramer said.\n\"Millennials [are] finally having children [and] spending money on them,\" he said. \"Maybe student loan debt and health care costs are less of a worry than we thought.\"\n3. Strategy Third, Cramer said traditional retailers' on- and offline strategies are finally starting to resonate with consumers.\n\"While they may have to partner with Amazon Web Services, they're also using the correct customer relationship software to maintain and enhance loyalty,\" he said. \"They have much better control over their inventory and they've finally figured out the positives of bricks-and-mortar, like buy online, pickup at the store .\"\n4. Failures In a time that's been something of a reckoning for retailers, the winners are taking market share as losers abound, Cramer said.\n\"The survivors are getting the spoils,\" the \"Mad Money\" host quipped.\n5. Valuation Finally, the market could still be undervaluing some stocks in the sector, Cramer said, arguing that it seemed \"ridiculous\" that Nordstrom isn't going private given the strength of its latest numbers.\n\"I feel the same way about the stock of Macy's ,\" Cramer said. \"I don't think people understand the magnitude of optionality that Macy's has if they get it right, and CEO Jeff Gennette is getting it very right. The fact that Macy's has cleaned up its balance sheet allows the company to do a lot more with a lot less.\"\nFinal thoughts \"I say now that retail's in a dry spell, and that happens in January, ... you need to buy this group the next time we get any kind of weakness here,\" Cramer concluded. \"The retailers aren't falling apart anymore.

That's going to flow down to capital.\"\nHe advises investors to stay focused on the core business and the banks' ability to grow.\nFor one, loan growth has been modest and he expects the yield spread to widen through 2018 as the Federal Reserve increases interest rates.\n\"That creates more opportunities for higher earnings for these banks,\" Leon said. \"Also, they're putting a lot of efforts on cost controls.\"\nJ.P. Morgan Chase, along with BlackRock and Wells Fargo , kick off the financial earnings season Friday morning.\nLeon has a buy rating on J.P. Morgan and a hold on Wells Fargo. His top pick is Bank of America , which he said is \"firing on all cylinders.\"\nFor his part, Goldberg expects JPM to have another good quarter. He has a $132 price target on the stock and an overweight rating.\n\"On a relative basis they continue to take market share across both their retail and wholesale businesses,\" he said. \"They're buying back a fair amount of stock. They seem to have a good line on the cost side,\" he said.\nGoldberg also has an overweight rating on Wells Fargo and a $75 price target.\n\"They are not fully out of the woods yet but they've made, I think, great strides in putting some of these legacy issues behind them in terms of the retail sales practices, kind of improving the culture, kind of weeding out and changing out some of the executive team,\" Goldberg noted.\n— CNBC's Gino Siniscalchi contributed to this report \nDisclosures: JPM and WFC are investment banking clients of Barclays.

S&P also cited a risk of greater policy uncertainty after this year's elections. \nThe decision underscored concerns that a business-friendly reform agenda proposed by the unpopular President Michel Temer may stall this year as a looming presidential race shortens the legislative calendar. \nThe Finance Ministry said in a statement that it would continue to push for an overhaul of Brazil's social security and tax policies, adding that S&P's decision underscored the urgency of those fiscal reforms. \nFinance Minister Henrique Meirelles had met with ratings agencies to try and stave off a downgrade after the government delayed until February a vote on pension reform that had been expected last year. \n\"I think it's a warning of the economic and social consequences of not approving pension reform,\" said Wellington Moreira Franco, secretary-general for President Michel Temer. \nThe move by S&P brings its long-term sovereign rating for Brazil three notches below investment grade. Brazil is rated Ba2 by Moody's Investors Service and BB by Fitch Ratings, both two notches into \"junk\" territory. \nBrazil lost its investment grade rating in 2015 as the country headed into its deepest recession in decades and the government of then-President Dilma Rousseff failed to tame a budget deficit that exploded when a commodities boom faded. \nThe S&P downgrade \"is a negative development but it was expected, particularly after pension reform was delayed. It's not breaking news for markets,\" said Goldman Sachs economist Alberto Ramos in by telephone. \nBrazilian index fund iShares MSCI Brazil ETF slipped 0.3 percent in after-market trading in New York after gaining 1.9 percent during the session. \n\"Regarding the economic effect, we will need to observe the market in the coming days. But this will aid the reform effort,\" a member of Temer's economic team said on condition of anonymity. \nA spokesman for Brazil's central bank declined to comment. \nThe downgrade highlights the stakes heading into this year's wide-open presidential election, with key fiscal measures hanging in the balance and voters seething after years of corruption scandals that tarred major political parties. \nMany in Brazil regarded S&P's decision to award Brazil an investment-grade rating in 2008, then the 14th government to receive the distinction, as validation of the country's growing leadership among emerging markets. \nSince taking office last year, Temer has vowed to regain Brazil's investment grade by cutting red tape, halting growth of public debt and privatizing state firms. \nYet Temer has struggled to close the deficit and was forced to shelve much of his reform agenda last year as he fought corruption charges that sank his approval rating into single digits.

It's bad enough to have a roomful of people witness your blunder and something else entirely to stumble in front of 100,000!\nOften, it's the words we perceive as being more \"correct\" or sophisticated that catch us by surprise when they don't really mean what we think they do. These words have a tendency to make even really smart people stumble.\nIronic vs. Coincidental A lot of people get this wrong. If you break your leg the day before a ski trip, that's not ironic — it's coincidental (and bad luck).\nIronic has several meanings, all of which include some type of reversal of what was expected. Verbal irony is when a person says one thing but clearly means another. Situational irony is when a result is the opposite of what was expected. O. Henry was a master of situational irony. In \"The Gift of the Magi,\" Jim sells his watch to buy combs for his wife's hair, and she sells her hair to buy a chain for Jim's watch. Each character sold something precious to buy a gift for the other, but those gifts were intended for what the other person sold. That is true irony.\nIf you break your leg the day before a ski trip, that's coincidental. If you drive up to the mountains to ski, and there was more snow back at your house, that's ironic.\nAffect vs. Effect To make these words even more confusing than they already are, both can be used as either a noun or a verb.\nLet's start with the verbs. Affect means to influence something or someone; effect means to accomplish something. \"Your job was affected by the organizational restructuring\" but \"These changes will be effected on Monday.\"\nAs a noun, an effect is the result of something: \"The sunny weather had a huge effect on sales.\" It's almost always the right choice because the noun affect refers to an emotional state and is rarely used outside of psychological circles: \"The patient's affect was flat.\"\nLie vs. Lay We're all pretty clear on the lie that means an untruth. It's the other usage that trips us up. Lie also means to recline: \"Why don't you lie down and rest?\" Lay requires an object: \" Lay the book on the table.\" Lie is something you can do by yourself, but you need an object to lay .\nIt's more confusing in the past tense. The past tense of lie is — you guessed it — lay : \"I lay down for an hour last night.\" And the past tense of lay is laid: \"I laid the book on the table.\"\nshow chapters Make your family more savvy around money with these fun ideas 11:35 AM ET Wed, 22 Feb 2017 | 01:28 Accept vs. Except These two words sound similar but have very different meanings. Accept means to receive something willingly: \"His mom accepted his explanation\" or \"She accepted the gift graciously.\" Except signifies exclusion: \"I can attend every meeting except the one next week.\"\nTo help you remember, note that both except and exclusion begin with ex .\nBring vs. Take Bring and take both describe transporting something or someone from one place to another, but the correct usage depends on the speaker's point of view. Somebody brings something to you, but you take it to somewhere else: \" Bring me the mail, then take your shoes to your room.\"\nJust remember, if the movement is toward you, use bring; if the movement is away from you, use take .\nBringing it all together English grammar can be tricky, and, a lot of times, the words that sound right are actually wrong. With words such as those above, you just have to memorize the rules so that when you are about to use them, you'll catch yourself in the act and know for certain that you've written or said the right one.\nDr. Travis Bradberry is the award-winning co-author of the No. 1 bestselling book, \"Emotional Intelligence 2.0\" and the co-founder of TalentSmart, the world's leading provider of emotional intelligence tests and training, serving more than 75 percent of Fortune 500 companies.\nLike this story?

That's not the debate. The debate is how do we know what the ideal surface temperature is in 2100? ... I think the American people deserve an open honest transparent discussion about those things,\" said Pruitt, who has frequently cast doubt on the causes and implications of global warming.\nPruitt reaffirmed plans for the EPA to host a public debate on climate science sometime this year that would pit climate change doubters against other climate scientists, but he provided no further details on timing or which scientists would be involved.\nPruitt said among the EPA's top priorities for 2018 will be to replace the Clean Power Plan, former President Barack Obama's centerpiece climate change regulation which would have slashed carbon emissions from power plants. The EPA began the process of rescinding the regulation last year and is taking input on what should replace it.\n\"A proposed rule will come out this year and then a final rule will come out sometime this year,\" he said. He did not give any details on what the rule could look like, saying the agency was still soliciting comments from stakeholders.\nHe said the agency was also planning to rewrite the Waters of the United States rule, another Obama-era regulation, this one defining which U.S. waterways are protected under federal law. Pruitt and Trump have said the rule marked an overreach by including streams that are shallow, narrow, or sometimes completely dry s and was choking off energy development.\nPruitt said that in both cases, former President Barack Obama had made the rules by executive order, and without Congress. \"We only have the authority that Congress gives us,\" Pruitt said.\nPruitt's plans to replace the Clean Power Plan have raised concerns by attorneys general of states like California and New York, who said in comments submitted to the EPA on Tuesday that the administrator should recuse himself because as Oklahoma attorney general he led legal challenges against it.\nBiofuels and staff cuts Pruitt said he hoped for legislative reform of the U.S. biofuels policy this year, calling it \"substantially needed and important\" because of the costs the regulation imposes on oil refiners.\nThe Renewable Fuel Standard, ushered in by former President George W. Bush as a way to help U.S. farmers, requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the nation's fuel supply every year.\nRefining companies say the EPA-administered policy costs them hundreds of millions of dollars annually and threatens to put some plants out of business. But their proposals to change the program have so far been rejected by the Trump administration under pressure from the corn lobby.\nThe EPA in November slightly raised biofuels volumes mandates for 2018, after previously opening the door to cuts.\nThe White House is now mediating talks on the issue between representatives of both sides, with input from EPA, and some Republican senators from states representing refineries are working on possible legislation to overhaul the program.\nPruitt said he also hoped Congress could produce an infrastructure package this year that would include replacing municipal water pipes, as a way of combating high lead levels in certain parts of the United States.\n\"That to me is something very tangible very important that we can achieve for the American people,\" he said.\nPruitt added that EPA also continuing its review of automobile fuel efficiency rules, and would be headed to California soon for more meetings with the California Air Resources Board to discuss them.\nCalifornia in 2011 agreed to adopt the federal vehicle emission rules through 2025, but has signaled it would opt out of the standards if they are weakened — a move that would complicate matters for automakers serving the huge California market.\nIn the meantime, Pruitt said EPA is continuing to reduce the size of its staff, which fell to 14,162 employees as of Jan. 3, the lowest it has been since 1998, under Ronald Reagan when the employment level was 14,400. The EPA employed about 15,000 when Obama left office.\nNearly 50 percent of the EPA will be eligible to retire within the next five years, according to the agency.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T05:19:11.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images Shoppers enter a Kohl's store in Peoria, Illinois. \nKohl's stock rallied 4.5 percent Friday after two Wall Street banks upgraded the company's shares. \nBoth J.P. Morgan and RBC Capital Markets cited Kohl's improving same-store sales (i.e., comp sales) in raising their ratings on the apparel department store. \n\"We see Kohl's as a rare large cap 'value' idea in consumer with its $75,000 to $80,000 household income core customer demographic and off-mall store fleet well positioned,\" J.P. Morgan analyst Matthew Boss wrote to clients. \"Kohl's underlying comp has improved sequentially four straight quarters with operational investments laying the foundation for multi-year low-single-digit same-store-sales.\" \nBoss raised his Kohl's price target to $72 from $51, which represents 18 percent upside through the next 12 months. \nShares of Kohl's have climbed 48 percent over the past 12 months and were set to add to the gains Friday morning. \nAnd while the company's initiatives could increase foot traffic at Kohl's stores, the analyst also highlighted its growing relationship with e-commerce giant Amazon. \n\"Management is encouraged with early indicators from its Amazon partnership, which first launched in September and includes 10 stores with Smart Home and 82 Kohl's stores taking Amazon returns,\" Boss added. \"While still in its early days, management is encouraged with customer engagement on both initiatives planning to assess post-Holiday traction to evaluate potential expansion.\" \nThe company also plans to partner with grocery or convenience store retailers to lease excess space left after downsizing approximately 300 stores over the past several years. The initiative seeks to take advantage of unused footage; a food and apparel combination could rival companies with a similar model, such as Target. \nRBC analyst Brian Tunick bumped his rating on Kohl's to sector perform from underperform, predicting that the stock will finish 2018 around its current level near $60. \n\"On the back of sequentially improving comps through 2017 which culminated in 7 percent comp for the Holiday period, combined with management's increased initiatives to optimize store fleet, focus on cost management and improve balance sheet position, we believe Kohl's is now better positioned to perform in line with the rest of our coverage,\" Tunick wrote Friday. \n— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.

Since then, in the eyes of mutual funds and other shareholders, the company has been unable to justify that price. \nBut as the cloud file sharing and document collaboration company prepares to go public, investment firms have been gradually marking the price up They now value the company at between about $6.6 billion and $8.5 billion, according to a CNBC analysis of regulatory filings. \nDropbox has confidentially filed for an IPO, CNBC reported on Thursday. In April, Bloomberg, which first broke the news about the confidential IPO filing, reported that Dropbox was profitable, excluding some taxes and other items. \nThe company did not provide a comment. \nDropbox is in a brutally competitive market, going up against Apple and Google for consumer file storage (photos and videos), and taking on a host of companies from Microsoft and Amazon to Box on the enterprise side. That's forced the company to shutter some big initiatives in its effort to find a money-making business model. \nIn 2015, as Box was struggling on the public markets, reports came out showing that some firms had severely marked down the value of their Dropbox holdings. show chapters 1:52 PM ET Thu, 11 Jan 2018 | 01:07 \nThe recent increases in Dropbox's price suggest that it might be a better time for the company to go public. But it will still need to grow profitably and excite the public markets to return money for many of its investors. \nAfter going public, Dropbox could wind up with a market cap below or equal to its $10 billion private valuation from 2014, said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director for private investment research at SharesPost. \nHe estimates that the company generated about $1 billion in revenue last year, with 25 percent growth and close to two-thirds of sales coming from enterprises. \n\"The bigger part of the story they would probably be looking to tell is they do not need a capital influx, given their financial profile,\" Kulkarni said. \"That would be the key argument that they would want to make to deserve a premium valuation, as opposed to many other cash-burning unicorns.\" \nHere's a rundown of some investment firms that have changed how they value Dropbox: \nBlackRock estimated that its shares in Dropbox were worth $18.23 each as of April 2015, but two and a half years later, at the end of October 2017, they were down 27 percent to $13.30. That's up from $10.87 a year earlier. BlackRock's global allocation fund got its stake in Dropbox in the company's January 2014 funding round. \nFidelity's Small Cap Growth K6 Fund has held stock in Dropbox since 2012. While at the end of July, the price was down 30 percent from early 2015, at $13.40, it was up from $11.10 a year earlier. \nGSV Capital, which got in Dropbox's series A-1 round, prices its shares 45 percent below where they were in mid-2015. The stock was pegged at $12.58 at the end of September. But that's up from $10.05 per share at the end of 2016. \nHartford Funds' Capital Appreciation Fund, which invested in Dropbox in 2014, priced the shares at $19.84 in October 2015. One year later the price fell to $19.10, and most recently it was down to $16.20. \nPrincipal's LargeCap Growth Fund I valued Dropbox shares at $19.10 in April 2015 after buying them in 2014, and they were down 33 percent to $12.79 at the end of October. That's up from $12.37 in April 2016. \nUSAA, whose Science & Technology Fund bought shares in Dropbox in 2012, valued them at $19.10 in April 2015. The price was marked down to $13.02 as of October, which was up from $11.03 a year earlier.

And because of the way bonuses are initially taxed, you might see a higher-than-normal withholding when you receive that extra pay.\nIn general, the federal supplemental tax rate of 22 percent applies, plus Social Security, Medicare, unemployment and your applicable state and local taxes. The federal rate may be more or less than your regular federal, state and local withholdings, depending on your income level. (See the new withholding rates below).\nThe Internal Revenue Service allows companies to use several methods to withhold taxes from bonuses, which the agency considers \"supplemental income.\" The first way would reduce your bonus by a flat rate of 22 percent regardless of your tax bracket. The other method would withhold taxes at whatever rate your regular income is taxed. (Bonuses above $1 million are taxed differently.)\nEither way, the amount could be smaller than you expect. However, at tax-filing time, you could see a refund if too much were withheld. Bonuses are added to whatever you've earned for the year when computing your tax bill.\n\"It's exciting to contemplate what you'd do with any amount of extra money, but it might cause you to make financial decisions that don't look so good in hindsight,\" said Kathryn Hauer, a certified financial planner with Aiken, South Carolina-based Wilson David Investment Advisors in a December interview.\nAmong the companies announcing worker windfalls, AT&T said it will give a $1,000 bonus to more than 200,000 U.S. employees; that applies to all union-represented, non-management and front-line managers. Comcast , which owns CNBC parent NBCUniversal, also said it plans to give $1,000 bonuses to more than 100,000 eligible employees.\nSinclair Broadcast Group of Baltimore said it will give a $1,000 bonus to almost 9,000 full- and part-time regular employees, and Bank of America said that U.S. employees earning up to $150,000 annually — about 145,000 workers — would get a $1,000 bonus by the end of last year.\nMeanwhile, BB&T has announced it will pay $1,200 bonuses in January to almost three-fourths of the bank's associates (about 27,000), and said it would raise its minimum hourly pay rate to $15 from $12, effective Jan. 1.\nAnd Cincinnati-based bank Fifth Third said it will give $1,000 bonuses to some employees, along with increasing the minimum wage it pays workers to $15. Wells Fargo also is increasing its minimum wage to $15.\nHauer recommends taking time to contemplate your options before spending money in anticipation of extra cash not yet received.\n\"We start spending money in our head long before we have it,\" she said. \"If we know — or even just think — we're getting a bonus, we tend to be less careful with our purchases and financial choices.\"\nRate Taxable Income Bracket 10% 0 to $19,050 12% $19,050 to $77,400 22% $77,400 to $165,000 24% $165,000 to $315,000 32% $315,000 to $400,000 35% $400,000 to $600,000 37% $600,000 and up First things first: If you work at one of the companies awarding bonuses, check with your human resources department about your eligibility.\nThen, here are some wise ways — albeit not as exciting as a shopping spree — to use the surprise bonus.\nPay down debt Consumer credit card debt stands at $808 billion, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The average interest rate on credit cards is 16.75 percent, according to Bankrate.com.\n\"The absolutely best thing you can do with any extra money is pay down credit card debt,\" Hauer said. \"It doesn't sound fun, but it's the wisest thing you can do financially.\"\nInvest it If you don't have credit card debt, you could put it in your retirement savings (i.e., your individual retirement account) or a child's 529 college savings plan. Depending on other elements of your tax situation, those contributions could be deductible. You have until tax day (April 17) to make a 2017 contribution to your IRA.\n\"If we know — or even just think — we're getting a bonus, we tend to be less careful with our purchases and financial choices.\" -Kathryn Hauer Donate it If you are charitably inclined, you could donate your bonus to a charitable organization and get a deduction for it.\nBasically, to get a tax break for the donation, you must itemize. While the tax bill retains the deduction for charitable giving, fewer taxpayers will end up using it because their deductions will not exceed the new, nearly doubled standard deduction of $24,000 for a married couple filing jointly.\nDo repairs If you've been putting off a repair — say, to a car or a household appliance — consider using the extra money to fix the issue. Some minor problems can snowball into major headaches and become necessary expenses.\n\"When the bigger problem does hit, you might have already spent the money and have to put the cost on a credit card,\" Hauer said.\n(Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported the supplemental withholding rate.)\nSee your new tax withholding rates\nHow to get your taxes done for free\nMany Americans don't have a plan to pay off their debts", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T17:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T17:59:36.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Clary | AFP | Getty Images Shoppers take advantage of Black Friday sales the day after Thanksgiving in New York City November 24, 2017. \nA day of speaking with the retail industry's top brass at the ICR's Conference in Orlando, Florida made Cramer realize that Wall Street might be discounting the sector's comeback. \n\"We're being way too cavalier about the return of retail, including mall-based retail and what it really means,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"We just can't believe that any of these companies can really escape the clutches of the Death Star, Amazon .\" \nAfter hearing that Kohl's delivered same-store sales of over 5 percent for the first time since 2001 and that Children's Place logged an 8.5 percent gain in holiday-season same-store sales, Cramer sensed that these were more than just positive blips on the retail radar screen. \nThen, when Target and Nordstrom's earnings kicked into high gear and both companies raised their holiday sales forecasts, Cramer started to suspect a genuine turn in the group as a whole. \nWith that in mind, Cramer shared five factors that could be driving the retail sector back into Wall Street's good graces. Denny's CEO: Bringing the 'old diner' back \nDenny's turnaround is all but a wholesale reinvention of the old-line diner chain, President and CEO John Miller told CNBC in an interview with Cramer. \n\"People said they want their old diner back,\" Miller told Cramer at the ICR Conference . \"It needed to be a place appropriate for dinner, so we warmed it up a little, divided the spaces.\" \nNow, about 67 percent of the Denny's network has embraced the chain's new image, with that number expected to rise to 80 percent by the end of 2018, Miller said. \nBesides refurbishing the stores, Denny's also introduced Denny's On Demand , which lets customers order food for take-out or delivery; new packaging for its food; health-focused meal options; value-oriented menus starting at $2; and meal personalization. \n\"We believe ... a great society runs best when you sort of push responsibility down,\" Miller said. \"Give people choice. Let them make their own decision. You want to indulge in a shake on Sunday, we'll sell it to you. But Monday morning you can have a Fit Slam egg white omelet.\" Away CEO talks brand engagement \nAway's digital-savvy luggage (complete with USB charging ports) has been exploding in popularity in two ways, co-founder and CEO Steph Korey told CNBC. \n\"The No. 1 way our customers find out about us is a recommendation from a friend,\" Korey told Cramer at the ICR Conference . \"We find that if we can create a special experience – like our web experience, our purchasing experience, our in-store experience, our product experience, how you travel – if we can create something that leaves a lasting impression with people, that's so rare these days that they'll tell everyone they know about it.\" \nThe second-biggest way people hear about Away? Instagram. And Korey said that's not only because of her company's social media prowess. \n\"Everyone's Instagramming when they're traveling and when they're seeing the world, so what we've really done is highly encourage our customers that when you're traveling and doing cool things, share it,\" she said. \"Inspire your networks and share what you're doing. So now, when people are traveling, they're going somewhere new, they're Instagramming themselves with their luggage and that's how people are finding out about it.\" Lightning Round: Stick with SLB \nIn Cramer's lightning round , he zoomed through his take on some callers' favorite stocks: \nCore Laboratories : \"I like Core Labs, but no need to go there if you own Schlumberger . Stick with that horse and buy more if it goes back to $72.\" \nCedar Fair, L.P. : \"You know what, I like them. I like how they're very streamlined and, most of all, I like the 5 percent yield.\" \nDisclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Citigroup, J.P. Morgan and Schlumberger. \nQuestions for Cramer?", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T02:09:57.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

That list includes names like Stride Rite, Hallmark, Claire's and Men's Wearhouse , the firm found. \nMore companies are choosing to silently shutter their doors by letting their leases terminate, thereby escaping any public mess, Jim Sullivan, president of Green Street's Advisory Group, told CNBC. \n\"Many important national retailers are closing ... where there hasn't been fanfare, and it hasn't been as obvious,\" Sullivan said. \"A lot of the focus has been on anchor-store closings, which is an important part, but some of these other signals are happening under the radar with the in-line tenants, which can be just as important but not as obvious.\" \nThese moves are likely to become a bigger trend in 2018, especially in the wake of real estate investment trust Simon Property Group winning a case brought against Starbucks . The coffee giant attempted to close a handful of its Teavana stores, but was blocked. The ruling was a win for real estate developers, but now retailers are prepared to be more subtle as they move out. \nMeanwhile, the pressure from these closures makes it easier for the re tailers that are still opening new stores across the country, including H&M, Land's End and Finish Line . These companies can be \"very selective,\" unlike how they operated in the past, and are rarely considering moving into anything but a \"high-quality\" property, Sullivan explained. \nBased on Green Street's Advisory Group'sanalysis, more store closures — whether done quietly or publicly — will separate America's best malls from the underperformers this year. \n\"In 2018 we'll see a broader distinction between the malls ... who are going to make it, and those who are really going to struggle to make it,\" Sullivan said. \nAlready, liquidation sales are in place for the 103 Sears and Kmart stores, and 11 Macy's locations , that will close early this year. Other names like Gap , Children's Place , Mattress Firm and Ascena Retail Group , the owner of Ann Taylor and Loft, are also expected to trim back their store counts in 2018. \nThe number of stores expected to close both in and out of malls across the U.S. this year totals 1,509, only 12 days into 2018, according to FGRT (formerly Fung Global Retail & Technology). That tally includes the 63 Sam's Club locations that Walmart revealed on Thursday would close as soon as this week . 'Business as usual' for some \nMall operators aren't just replacing retailers with other retailers. Faced with the threat of having a dark box at one of their properties, most developers say they've been lining up a new host of tenants that include upscale restaurants, arcade complexes, bowling alleys, grocers, gyms and even apartment complexes. \nTo be sure, some retail REITs are in a better position to fund their redevelopment journeys than others. \n\"The key thing to remember is for the 'A' mall guys in general — they can fund the redevelopments from the free cash flow they have on hand,\" Boenning & Scattergood analyst Floris van Dijkum told CNBC. \"It's business as usual\" for names like Simon, General Growth Properties , Macerich and Taubman , he said regarding the latest store closure announcements from Macy's and Sears . \n\"For the 'B' and 'C' mall guys, it's going to call into question the viability of that property because the returns aren't as high,\" van Dijkum cautioned. For some mall owners in more rural areas, redevelopment expenses might be too high, and tenants' rents too low to justify such an undertaking, he said. \nAcross the U.S., more than 300 malls are considered \"C\" quality, or likely producing less than $300 in sales per square foot, and face the risk of going dark, according to CoStar Group. \"These assets may close or be reinvented into something else,\" Suzanne Mulvee, a senior real estate strategist at CoStar, told CNBC. \"We expect this to be a multi-year process, only accelerated by chains closing large numbers of stores, especially anchors.\" \nIt used to be retailers were cheered on by Wall Street for adding more locations, she explained. \"Store count and market capitalization were going hand-in-hand right up until the housing bust ... then the ugly truth showed up.\" \nHowever, Pennsylvania REIT CEO Joe Coradino told CNBC the closing of underperforming department stores is a \"win-win.\" A company like Sears can focus on its better real estate, he said, and PREIT can revamp a portion of its mall to hopefully appeal to more shoppers. \n\"Where we have added new uses, like entertainment and off-price, we have seen traffic increases and new customers,\" Coradino said. \"We are really excited by all of the new [companies] that have become interested in malls — tenants have become agnostic to center format and are looking at the best locations, which is opening up a new breed of businesses.\" \nReplacements for recently shuttered Sears stores in particular include \"eater-tainment\" venues, like Dave & Buster's , low-price grocery chain Lidl, and TJX 's brands HomeGoods and HomeSense. \n\"We can take back [space] at that mall and use that as a catalyst to bring in other types of users,\" Stephen Lebovitz, the CEO of CBL Properties , told CNBC. And in some cases, based on contractual agreements, CBL will be working with Sears in the future to reopen in a pint-sized format, he added. J.C. Penny has also taken on a second life in malls in similar arrangements. \nStill, Wall Street isn't convinced all of these projects will be successful. \nShares of CBL have fallen more than 48 percent over the past 12 months. Rival Washington Prime Group 's stock has fallen 30 percent over the same period, whereas PREIT's shares are down 36 percent from a year ago. \n\"A\" mall developers including Simon have fared slightly better, especially building on recent M&A chatter (Brookfield making a bid for GGP) and activist activity in the space. \nThe question many analysts and investors continue to ask is: how costly are these mall redevelopments, and how timely of a process are they? \n\"[Redevelopment] does cost money, but we have laid out a detailed capital plan where we are selling non-core assets — that we don't want to invest in or don't fit with our strategy — and raising funds in creative ways,\" Coradino said. \nStore closures aside, more bankruptcies are looming and many could hit early this year, according to Credit Suisse Group . The industry's \"large and undeniable transformation\" could ultimately impair rents and vacancy rates at some retail properties in 2018, strategists Roger Lehman and Benjamin Rozyn wrote in a recent note to clients. \nThat won't leave mall owners with much time to react, so they better be ready.

It will have other accommodations for hearing and visually impaired customers. \nThis will be one of the first self-driving vehicles in commercial passenger service and among the first to do away with manual controls for steering, brakes and throttle. What is the driver’s seat in the Bolt EV will become the front left passenger seat in the Cruise AV, GM said. \nCompany President Dan Ammann told reporters GM had filed on Thursday for government approval to deploy the “first production-ready vehicle designed from the start without a steering wheel, pedals or other unnecessary manual controls.” \nGM is part of a growing throng of vehicle manufacturers, technology companies and tech startups seeking to develop so-called robo-taxis over the next three years in North America, Europe and Asia. Most of those companies have one or more partners. \nOn Friday, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration confirmed GM had petitioned for approval to operate up to 2,500 vehicles without steering wheels or human drivers. “Safety is the (Transportation) department’s top priority. The department will review this petition and give it careful consideration,” the agency said in a statement. \nFord Motor Co ( F.N ) said on Tuesday it will partner with delivery service Postmates Inc as the automaker starts testing ways to transport people, food and packages this spring in its self-driving cars, which are being developed by Ford’s Argo unit. \nOther companies, from Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] to Alphabet Inc’s ( GOOGL.O ) Waymo, have been testing self-driving vehicle prototypes in limited ride sharing applications, but have been less explicit than GM in announcing plans for commercial robo-taxi services. Slideshow (2 Images) \nGM executives said the automaker has asked the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to allow 16 alterations to existing vehicle safety rules - such as having an airbag in what would normally be the driver’s seat, but without a steering wheel - to enable the deployment of the Cruise AV. \nThe automaker would then need to obtain similar approval from individual U.S. states. GM executives said seven U.S. states already allow the alterations sought by the automaker. In other states - including those that stipulate a car must have a licensed human driver - GM will work with regulators to change or get a waiver from existing rules. \nThe company declined to identify the first states in which it plans to launch the vehicle or say when it would begin testing. \nGM wants to control its own self-driving fleet partly because of the tremendous revenue potential it sees in selling related services, from e-commerce to infotainment, to consumers riding in those vehicles. \nAt a Nov. 30 briefing in San Francisco, GM’s Ammann told investors the lifetime revenue generation of one of its self-driving cars could eventually be “several hundred thousands of dollars.” That compares with the $30,000 on average that GM collects today for one of its vehicles, mostly derived from the initial sale. \nGM’s Cruise AV is equipped with the automaker’s fourth-generation self-driving software and hardware, including 21 radars, 16 cameras and five lidars - sensing devices that use laser light to help autonomous cars “see” nearby objects and obstacles. \nThe Cruise AV will be able to operate in hands-free mode only in premapped urban areas. \nGM’s prototype self-driving vehicles have been developed in San Francisco by Cruise Automation, the onetime startup that GM acquired in March 2016 for a reported $1 billion.

It's totally lacking in rigor, but it happens all the time around here, and that's what threw us off today,\" the \" Mad Money \" host said.\nCramer was referencing a high-profile narrative: scores of market commentators have been worried about a flattening yield curve , which many see as a precursor to recession.\nWithout a meaningful inflection in the yield curve, short-term Treasury returns almost equal the returns for long-term Treasurys. Paired with a too-abrupt rise in interest rates, that could curb demand for loans, putting a damper on the broader economy.\n\"But here's the thing: if China comes into the market and starts dumping longer-term Treasurys, we won't have a flat yield curve anymore,\" Cramer said. \"Long-term rates will go higher, and bears lose their big thesis propping up the idea that a recession's right around the corner.\"\nThat was Cramer's main problem: how could the bears be worried that long-term rates are far too low, but panic when the Chinese float the possibility of making our long-term rates go up?\n\"Can both sides really be bearish — heads I win, tails you lose? You know that's insane,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\"Let me make one thing crystal-clear: this is not a be-careful-what-you-wish-for story. We want rates higher, period. The pace of loan growth in this country is slowing, something I'm sure we're going to hear about when the big banks start reporting ,\" he continued. \"Higher long-term rates will make banks eager to lend, so [the] more bonds the Chinese dump, the better.\"\nInflation is at the center of this debate, Cramer said. Some market-watchers remain worried that there isn't enough inflation in the economy, which can translate into lower wage growth, less consumer spending and obstacles to the Federal Reserve's rate-hike agenda .\n\"You can't have it both ways. You can't say, 'Boohoo, there's no inflation, let's sell stocks,' and then say, 'Boohoo, there's inflation, let's sell stocks.' It is either, people, one way or the other,\" Cramer said.\nPeople who say both usually have skin in the game, he added. Money managers who need to outperform the broader averages are incentivized to say what they can to send the market lower.\nBut homegamers should take Wall Street worries with a grain of salt, the \"Mad Money\" host advised.\n\"The bottom line? Don't be careful what you wish for. When good things happen, embrace them,\" Cramer said. \"There's a cohort of money managers out there who need stocks to go lower and they will say anything to make you feel afraid. They are the anti-Goldilocks crowd; nothing is ever right for these people. It's always too high or too low and definitely pointing to some looming catastrophe. These bears would be great in a horror movie — just please don't take their financial advice all that seriously.\"\nWATCH: Cramer calls out market disparity show chapters Cramer makes the bull case for China's move to cut US debt purchases      18 Hours Ago | 12:46 Questions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

The people are hungry!” says the narrator of the video, who filmed the incident from his car. Lawmaker Paparoni said some 300 animals were believed to have been killed. Reuters could not verify the information. \nZuley Urdaneta, a 50 year-old vet in Merida, witnessed the looting of a truck along the highway around 2 p.m. on Thursday afternoon. About two hours later, he said some 800 people converged on a food collection center and proceeded to plunder it. \n“They knocked down the gates and looted flour, rice, cooking oil, cooking gas,” said Urdaneta. “The police and the National Guard tried to control the situation by giving out what was left.” \nFor more on the crisis in Venezuela, watch Fortune’s video: \nLooting has been increasing in the provinces since Christmas, with food shortages and hyperinflation leaving millions of people hungry, though the capital, Caracas, has so far been largely unaffected. \nThe opposition says Maduro’s failed economic policies and rampant corruption are to blame for the meltdown in the once booming country home to the world’s largest crude reserves. \n“What we’re living is barbaric,” said opposition lawmaker Juan Guaido in a tweet referencing the slaughter the cattle. “The dehumanizing regime of Nicolas Maduro is turning a blind eye to the tragedy that we Venezuelans are living.” \nMaduro’s government accuses political opponents and business-friendly foreign powers of trying to foment a social uprising against him by stoking inflation and hoarding food. \nIn what they said was an attempt to combat “speculation,” authorities last week forced over 200 supermarkets to slash prices, creating chaos as desperate Venezuelans leapt at the chance to buy cheaper food. \nSome supermarkets were sold out of fruit and vegetables, and staff were unsure if the shelves would be replenished.

They sparked bipartisan backlash to the president, with many lawmakers calling them un-American or unhelpful. \nGraham — one of the most notable Republican advocates for both hawkish national security positions and protections for young undocumented immigrants — had recently backed off criticism of Trump as he pushed for his policy goals. \nTwo other GOP Trump allies who attended the meeting — Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and David Perdue, R-Ga. – said Friday that they \"do not recall\" Trump \"saying these comments specifically.\" \nIn a tweet Friday morning, Trump said he used \"tough\" language at the meeting. \n\"But this was not the language I used,\" he added, apparently referencing the report of him saying \"s---hole.\" \nTrump also denied saying \"anything derogatory\" about Haitians. Trump tweet 2 \nHere's Graham's full statement on Thursday's meeting: \n\"Yesterday Senator Durbin and I met with President Trump at the White House to discuss our bipartisan proposal on border security and immigration. \n\"Following comments by the President, I said my piece directly to him yesterday. The President and all those attending the meeting know what I said and how I feel. I've always believed that America is an idea, not defined by its people but by its ideals. \n\"The American ideal is embraced by people all over the globe. It was best said a long time ago, E Pluribus Unum – Out of Many, One. Diversity has always been our strength, not our weakness. In reforming immigration we cannot lose these American Ideals. \n\"The American people will ultimately judge us on the outcome we achieve, not the process which led to it. \"I know the bipartisan proposal discussed at the White House can get a lot of support from both sides. As always, I look forward to considering additional ideas that could make the proposal even better. \n\"I appreciate Senator Durbin's statements and have enjoyed working with him and many others on this important issue.

He told the news site: \"We wish this was easier, but no ticketing options exist which can handle large volumes of ticket sales, and transaction fees on the Bitcoin blockchain exceed $30 at certain times of the day.\"\nRelatively slow transaction times and high processing fees for bitcoin payments have led to many merchants rethinking their decisions to accept cryptocurrencies. For example, tech giant Microsoft temporarily stopped taking bitcoin as a payment option at its store, before resuming such transactions. Last month, gaming platform Steam also stopped accepting payments in bitcoin, citing \"high fees\" and \"volatility.\"\nAccording to industry site BitInfoCharts, in the last three months, the average bitcoin transaction fee was as high as $55.

In a series of public comments, Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged what many people already knew: Facebook has become an unpleasant place that can make users feel lonely and frustrated. \nZuckerberg has also resolved to do something about it. He’s made fixing Facebook his annual challenge for 2018 and, in a candid interview, described the project as a duty to his daughters. \n“It’s important to me that when Max and August grow up that they feel like what their father built was good for the world,” Mr. Zuckerberg told the New York Times . \nThere’s no doubt Zuckerberg can make such changes—he’s a gifted CEO, beloved by his employees, who has total control over the company he started in a dorm room in 2004. The question is whether he’ll actually follow through, or if his grand plan will be just another marketing exercise. \nYes, Zuckerberg has already announced changes, such as favoring interaction with family and friends over businesses. But there are other big steps he could take to show us he’s sincere about fixing Facebook. Here are five: 1) Come clean about how Facebook finds “friends” \nFacebook’s “People You May Know” algorithm is one of its most powerful tools, but also a big reason the social network can feel like it’s run by a sociopathic manipulator. As investigative journalist Kashmir Hill revealed , Facebook’s aggressive data-mining tactics have led to many unsettling situations. \nThese include an anonymous sperm donor seeing his daughter as a possible “friend” on Facebook, and patients in the same psychiatric office seeing others suggested as “people they may know.” \nFacebook has resolutely refused to shed any light on how any of this works, or to give users more control over who can find them. If Zuckerberg really wants to make Facebook a more hospitable place, he can start by shedding light on one of its most unsettling features. 2) Give us a switch for babies and animals \nI have nothing against babies but I don’t want them in my Facebook feed. Unfortunately, Facebook’s engagement-obsessed algorithm insists there’s nothing better than a baby—and shows a steady parade of children, often born to people I barely know. This is a minor nuisance to me, but it could be heart-breaking for those who’ve lost a child or want one badly. \nFacebook’s artificial intelligence is certainly good enough to identify infant images, and let people choose to see fewer of them—or, if they wish, even more of them. Likewise, the pet-obsessed like to post photos of their puppies and kitties. Why not create a setting to let us see more or fewer animals? 3) Go speak before Congress \nThere’s plenty of evidence to suggest the Kremlin and other agitators used Facebook’s powerful viral machinery to sow discord among Americans: Posts intended to cause mischief about everything from Black Lives Matter to Texas secession helped exacerbate the country’s political divisions during a turbulent election year. \nZuckerberg has at least stopped saying it’s “crazy” to think none of this propaganda had any influence. But if he really wants to show the American people he cares about his company’s impact on democracy, he can testify in person—rather than sending lawyers or lieutenants—before one of the ongoing Congressional investigations. As early Facebook investor Roger McNamee recently wrote in Washington Monthly : \n“While many of the folks who run Silicon Valley are extreme libertarians, the people who work there tend to be idealists. They want to believe what they’re doing is good. Forcing tech CEOs like Zuckerberg to justify the unjustifiable, in public—without the shield of spokespeople or PR spin—would go a long way to puncturing their carefully preserved cults of personality in the eyes of their employees. 4) Hire a public editor \nZuckerberg announced that Facebook intends to downplay posts by news publishers, but this doesn’t change the fact he runs the most powerful media and advertising company in history (don’t forget Facebook owns Instagram and WhatsApp too). \nIf he is sincere about reducing the fake and low-calorie news stories clogging up users’ Facebook feed, Zuckerberg could turn to the press for help. He could name a professional journalist as a public editor, and give him or her an inside view of Facebook’s media operations—and let them report on the company’s impact on the media. \nEven better, he could appoint two such people—a liberal and a conservative—to help deflect accusations of political bias. 5) Let users be their own algorithm \nThis is easily the biggest thing Zuckerberg could do to improve Facebook: Turn over the keys for its all-powerful algorithms to the people who have to live under them. Instead of seeing a selection of posts curated by a Facebook programmer, users could select for themselves exactly what they want to see. For some, this might be news articles and, for others, it might be babies. \nThis element of choice would make the Facebook experience feel more dignified, and less manipulative. It would take some practice of course—the existing curation is useful because it lets users see a handful of items rather than the hundreds or thousands of things people post—but a company as clever as Facebook can surely provide tools to winnow down the scope on their own. \n“The first four words of Facebook’s mission have always been ‘give people the power’,” Zuckerberg wrote this week.

In all, the new legislation has increased the standard deduction, done away with personal exemptions and trimmed individual income tax rates. \nThis means you could start seeing changes to your paychecks as early as next month. \nYou should take a look your withholding to make sure you're deducting the correct amount of taxes under the new legislation. \n\"You don't want a big refund, where you're giving an interest-free loan to the government,\" said Melissa Labant, director of tax policy and advocacy at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. \n\"You also don't want a big balance due,\" she said. Your W-4 \nFor now, the Treasury's guidance is intended for employers to make adjustments to their payroll systems. \nIt's intended to work with a key form — the W-4 — that determines how much income tax is withheld from your pay, based on whether your spouse works, whether you have children and other factors. \nAt the moment, the IRS intends its guidance to work with the W-4 you currently have on file at your employer. \nHowever, the agency is working on a new Form W-4, and it plans on rolling out a calculator that will reflect the new tax law by the end of February. Further changes will be coming in 2019. A second look \nReviewing your W-4 is a good practice in any tax year. If not enough is withheld, you'll owe money come tax time. Pay too much, and you end up with a large refund . \n\"You may have different circumstances now compared to when you started working at your employer,\" Labant said. \nMajor life changes, including having a child or getting married, may warrant an update to your withholding. \nFor reference, here are the new income tax brackets for married couples.

JD.com declined to give a dollar number for the investment, when contacted by Reuters. \n“With JD’s expertise in leveraging social media for e-commerce, Tiki.vn’s partnership with VNG in social network and mobile payments is a natural fit,” Winston Cheng, president of JD.com’s international business, said in the statement. \nVietnam is the latest focal point in JD.com’s strategic push into Southeast Asia, where Alibaba and Amazon have also made significant investments in the past year. \nJD.com will tap Tiki.vn’s warehousing and delivery system, as well as its technology and payments capabilities. \nTiki.vn and VNG’s tie-up has similarities to the partnership between JD.com Inc and internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, which is an investor in JD.com and Asia’s largest tech firm by market cap. \nJD.com leverages data and payments from Tencent’s WeChat, China’s most popular social media app, and will seek to build similar capabilities with VNG and Tiki.vn, Cheng told Reuters. \nWhile Southeast Asia’s e-commerce market is still nascent compared to the China‘s, improvement in internet services and an increase in mobile-based payments have attracted large international e-commerce firms to the region. \nAlibaba has invested heavily in payment and e-commerce ventures in Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia. U.S. retailer Amazon also launched its subscription-based Prime service in Singapore last month in a bid to challenge Alibaba-backed online retailer Lazada Group in Southeast Asia. \nJD.com launched a local online retail business in Indonesia two years ago, and now claims to be the country’ largest retailer by revenue. It also formed a $500 million e-commerce venture with Thai retailer Central Group. \nBesides VNG, Tiki.vn’s previous investors include Seedcom, Sumitomo Corp and CyberAgent Ventures. \n($1 = 22,709.0000 dong)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T05:23:41.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Abel currently is the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company, which he joined in 1992.\nJain, 66, was named vice chair of the insurance operations.

Our directors also believe that an incoming CEO should be relatively young, so that he or she can have a long run in the job. Berkshire will operate best if its CEOs average well over ten years at the helm. (It's hard to teach a new dog old tricks.) And they are not likely to retire at 65 either (or have you noticed?). In both Berkshire's business acquisitions and large, tailored investment moves, it is important that our counterparties be both familiar with and feel comfortable with Berkshire's CEO. Developing confidence of that sort and cementing relationships takes time. The payoff, though, can be huge. Both the board and I believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO – a successor ready to assume the job the day after I die or step down. In certain important respects, this person will do a better job than I am doing.\"\nFor many years, it was thought that person was Jain because Buffett has often spoken about him so highly.\nDaniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images Ajit Jain, head of the Berkshire Hathaway reinsurance business. Buffett wrote in his annual letter last year: \"Ajit has created tens of billions of value for Berkshire shareholders. If there were ever to be another Ajit and you could swap me for him, don't hesitate. Make the trade!\"\nBut lately, Abel has been discussed as the most likely successor given his younger age and success in running the utility business.\n\"The most likely successor in our view, who Warren Buffett regularly praises, is Greg Abel,\" J.P. Morgan analyst Sarah DeWitt wrote in a note about Berkshire in September. \"Ajit Jain, who runs Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance, is also believed by many to be a potential successor, although our sense is his age may preclude him.\"\n\"We think Greg Abel would be a strong allocator of capital and the earning power of the underlying businesses would remain strong after Buffett,\" DeWitt added.\nBuffett has guided the sprawling conglomerate to a 20.8 percent compounded annual gain from 1965 through 2016, double the return of the S&P 500 over that period.\nTo achieve that market-beating return, Buffett has assembled a collection of cash-generating industrial and insurance businesses through acquisitions and in turn, invested that cash to make astute large bets on public stocks.\nWhoever takes over for Buffett will likely not retain that full stock-picking role because Buffett brought in two hedge fund managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, in the last decade to do more of the investing.\nBerkshire's B share class traded lower after the announcement as investors began to think again about the future of the company without the Oracle of Omaha in charge.\n\"The stock is likely to drop, perhaps substantially over an extended period when Warren Buffett steps down, although this could ultimately present a buying opportunity because the underlying fundamentals should continue to improve and the board could repurchase significant amounts of stock if the shares fell below 1.2x book value,\" DeWitt's note said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T13:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T14:16:34.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Crude futures, which were down about 30 percent from their June highs at that point, collapsed 10 percent in the next session and eventually plunged to 12-year lows . \nThe Saudis strategy of letting the oil market balance itself failed as U.S. producers learned to pump at lower prices. OPEC eventually conceded and agreed in November 2016 to curb output . \nNow, oil prices are at the highest closing levels since December 2014 and within close range of prices last seen on Nov. 28, 2014, the day after OPEC's decision. \nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude ended Tuesday's session at $62.96 per barrel, compared with $66.15 on Nov. 28, 2014. Brent crude , the international benchmark, settled at $68.82, versus $70.15 the day after Thanksgiving 2014, when the market was closed. \nOn Wednesday, WTI hit a session peak of $63.67, its highest level since Dec. 9, 2014. Brent topped out at $69.37 on Wednesday, coming within 30 cents of taking out its May 2015 high. \nIt's uncertain whether the rally has enough momentum to close the gap with the post-Thanksgiving 2014 levels. From there, it's a long way to the pre-OPEC decision levels. WTI closed at $73.69 and Brent settled at $77.75 on Nov. 26, 2014. \nIn the first half of 2018, the seasonal drop in oil demand could pull crude futures out of sync with other commodities that are rallying, said Kevin Book, head of research for oil, gas and coal at Clearview Energy Partners. \n\"On a fundamental basis, the first half of year is about 1.5 million barrels per day weaker from a demand perspective than the second half of the year,\" he told CNBC's \" Squawk Box \" on Wednesday. show chapters 5 Hours Ago | 03:35 \nOn the other hand, OPEC's production cuts helped reduce huge stockpiles of oil around the world toward the five-year average, and Brent crude prices could average closer to $60 per barrel this year if supply and demand remain roughly balanced, he said. \nOPEC's output curbs should continue to pay off, Scott Nations, president and chief investment officer at NationsShares, told CNBC's \" Futures Now \" on Tuesday. \n\"We're now at the top of this trading channel we've been in since June,\" he said. \"It now looks like we've shifted into another gear once we got the news that crude oil in storage in Cushing has fallen below 50 million barrels for first time in nearly three years.\" \nTraders closely watch stockpile levels at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub for U.S. crude for signs of oversupply and undersupply.

He then cross-referenced digital fingerprints associated with those sites to ones used almost exclusively by Fancy Bear, which his Tokyo-based firm dubs \"Pawn Storm.\"\nTrend Micro previously drew international attention when it used an identical technique to uncover a set of decoy websites apparently set up to harvest emails from the French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron's campaign in April 2017. The sites' discovery was followed two months later by a still-unexplained publication of private emails from several Macron staffers in the final days of the race.\nHacquebord said the rogue Senate sites — which were set up in June and September of 2017 — matched their French counterparts.\n\"That is exactly the way they attacked the Macron campaign in France,\" he said.\nAttribution is extremely tricky in the world of cybersecurity, where hackers routinely use misdirection and red herrings to fool their adversaries. But Tend Micro, which has followed Fancy Bear for years, said there could be no doubt.\n\"We are 100 percent sure that it can attributed to the Pawn Storm group,\" said Rik Ferguson, one of the Hacquebord's colleagues.\nLike many cybersecurity companies, Trend Micro refuses to speculate publicly on who is behind such groups, referring to Pawn Storm only as having \"Russia-related interests.\" But the U.S. intelligence community alleges that Russia's military intelligence service pulls the hackers' strings and a months-long Associated Press investigation into the group, drawing on a vast database of targets supplied by the cybersecurity firm Secureworks, has determined that the group is closely attuned to the Kremlin's objectives.\nIf Fancy Bear has targeted the Senate over the past few months, it wouldn't be the first time. An AP analysis of Secureworks' list shows that several staffers there were targeted between 2015 and 2016.\nAmong them: Robert Zarate, now the foreign policy adviser to Florida Senator Marco Rubio; Josh Holmes, a former chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who now runs a Washington consultancy; and Jason Thielman, the chief of staff to Montana Senator Steve Daines. A Congressional researcher specializing in national security issues was also targeted.\nFancy Bear's interests aren't limited to U.S. politics; the group also appears to have the Olympics in mind.\nTrend Micro's report said the group had set up infrastructure aimed at collecting emails from a series of Olympic winter sports federations, including the International Ski Federation, the International Ice Hockey Federation, the International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation, the International Luge Federation and the International Biathlon Union.\nThe targeting of Olympic groups comes as relations between Russia and the International Olympic Committee are particularly fraught. Russian athletes are being forced to compete under a neutral flag in the upcoming Pyeongchang Olympics following an extraordinary doping scandal that has seen 43 athletes and several Russian officials banned for life. Amid speculation that Russia could retaliate by orchestrating the leak of prominent Olympic officials' emails, cybersecurity firms including McAfee and ThreatConnect have picked up on signs that state-backed hackers are making moves against winter sports staff and anti-doping officials.\nOn Wednesday, a group that has brazenly adopted the Fancy Bear nickname began publishing what appeared to be Olympics and doping-related emails from between September 2016 and March 2017. The contents were largely unremarkable but their publication was covered extensively by Russian state media and some read the leak as a warning to Olympic officials not to press Moscow too hard over the doping scandal.\nWhether any Senate emails could be published in such a way isn't clear. Previous warnings that German lawmakers' correspondence might be leaked by Fancy Bear ahead of last year's election there appear to have come to nothing.\nOn the other hand, the group has previously dumped at least one U.S. legislator's correspondence onto the web.\nOne of the targets on Secureworks' list was Colorado State Senator Andy Kerr, who said thousands of his emails were posted to an obscure section of the website DCLeaks — a web portal better known for publishing emails belonging to retired Gen. Colin Powell and various members of Hillary Clinton's campaign — in late 2016.\nKerr said he was still bewildered as to why he was targeted. He said that while he supported transparency, \"there should be some process and some system to it.\n\"It shouldn't be up to a foreign government or some hacker to say what gets released and what shouldn't.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T15:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T15:38:47.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

But it could sting exporters and farmers longer term since the United States is Canada's biggest wheat, hog and cattle export market. \nThe country's energy industry does not expect tariffs to be imposed on oil and gas exports, said Nick Schultz of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, given that would amount to an additional cost to U.S. refiners, which import 3 million barrels a day of Canadian crude.

IBM also reports though tech companies will be dominating results later in the month.\n\"The pivotal question is we will be getting guidance on tax reform. We know it's a positive, we just don't know how much,\" said Lori Calvasina, who heads U.S. equity strategy at RBC.\nThe fourth quarter is the final quarter where corporations were subject to the 35 percent corporate rate, and now companies are expected to detail how the new tax law will affect them. \"The risk is the net effect isn't as positive as expected,\" she said.\nshow chapters JP Morgan rallies on earnings, but that's bad news for one trader 21 Hours Ago | 01:33 But Calvasina said she believes after studying the comments from more than 200 major companies, there still is not clarity from managements, and the impact on profits is not fully priced in, as a result. \"There's probably more upside risk than downside risk,\" she said.\nTax reform is one of the factors that has helped the stock market rally into the new year, and the bull still appears unstoppable early on in the earnings season.

The Russell 3000 represents about 98.5 percent of the U.S. market cap.\nThe S&P 500 is up more than 4 percent since just the beginning of the year, having tagged on another 1.5 percent in the past week. The market has been lifted by expectations for a strong economy , and the prospect that earnings will be good and get even better, when the impact of new 21 percent corporate tax rate is factored in.\nSource: Bespoke\nPaul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke, said he sees a warning sign in the earnings this season. \"The pace of positive revisions to negative revisions haven't been higher than at any time in 10 years. That's a function of the tax bill,\" said Hickey. \"This is the first quarter in 13 quarters when there's been more positive revisions in the month leading up to earnings than negative revisions.\"\nThe concern is that analysts lowered the bar with reduced estimates, ahead of those other earnings reporting seasons, making it easier for stocks to realize an earnings pop, but this time, analysts are raising the bar.\n\"Early on, in these reports, we want to see stocks reacting well, and so far its been pretty good. It's early,\" said Hickey, adding the real test will come when tech names report. Those have been the best performers of 2016, and the group as a whole is expected to see the least benefit from the tax bill.\nshow chapters IBM a sleeper earnings pick? 21 Hours Ago | 03:59 For the fourth quarter, earnings are expected to grow by 12.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters. Energy companies are expected to see the best profit growth, up nearly 140 percent, followed by materials, up 25 percent, according to Thomson Reuters. Financial companies are expected to see 13 percent earnings growth for the fourth quarter.\nOf the roughly two dozen companies that have reported so far, about three in four have beaten expectations.\nCalvasina said if earnings estimates are raised by 10 percent after companies reveal the impact of tax law changes, the price to earnings ratio would fall to 17.6 from about 19.4.\n\"I don't think the tax is going to take market valuations and make them look cheap, but it's going to give us some breathing room,\" she said.\nCalvasina expects the S&P 500 to finish the year at 3,000. Like many analysts, she does see a pullback coming this year after barely a sell off last year. \"I don't think an imminent pullback is coming. I think it's going to be later this year,\" she said.\nEven so, some traders are getting a bit anxious about the way the market has run higher. \"There's a pain trade being created,\" said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com who follows the short term technicals. \"Sometimes fast and furious markets might be great for statements and 401ks, but for traders, when you get a little extreme, it definitely creates anxiety and a little more stress than if you had a pause.\"\n'When you're up six, seven, eight, nine days, it makes you feel like you're chasing, and as a trader it's harder to enter. You remember the prices you had a week ago,\" he said. \"Traders are probably a little more anxious and frustrated than they were with the S&P 40 handles lower.\"\nOn the economic front, there are a few reports in the week ahead.

The stock fell in Tuesday trading, just one session after surging over 6 percent — its best day since September. Although the stock is still off 14 percent from its all-time high, now could be the prime time to buy. \"If you own it, you hold it. If you're thinking about buying it, now's the time,\" Rich Ross, head of technical analysis at Evercore ISI, said Monday on CNBC's \" Trading Nation .\" According to Ross, the stock has managed to hold what he calls a critical level of support at $300 per share, and absent a break below that level, the stock may shoot back up to its highs around $390 to $400 per share. \n\"When you zoom out and look longer term, this is where you can see the potential for that upside. Tesla loves the counter-trend rally. When the stock pulls back as it has from those highs last May, you're setting yourself up for a slingshot off of that critical support. You see that prior resistance, which once again becomes support at $290, $300, you got the 50-week moving average. … So I think Tesla is a buy here,\" Ross said, examining a chart of Tesla stock back to 2013. Considering the stock's fundamental backdrop, however, others are far less optimistic. Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager with Fort Pitt Capital Group, is concerned with the company's execution on deliveries . The company last week announced fourth-quarter deliveries numbers that fell short of expectations. As a result, it pushed back production targets on its forthcoming Model 3 sedan. \"No doubt they make some compelling cars and they have some great ideas, but as we're seeing once again with the Model 3, they can't really get things out on time, and they're burning cash like mad. I would say stay far away from this, but if you want to buy Tesla, buy a car, and enjoy the ride,\" Forrest said Monday on \"Trading Nation.\" \nThe stock traded about 1 percent lower in Wednesday's premarket.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T15:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T15:24:11.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The sitting U.S. president has to agree to suspend sanctions every 120 to 180 days.\n\"The prognosis for the Iranian nuclear deal in 2018 also looks fairly bleak, and the persistent threat of a U.S. sanctions snapback could curtail foreign investment in the Iranian energy sector and imperil output expansion plans.\" -Helima Croft, RBC Capital Markets global head of commodity strategy Starting Friday, Trump faces several deadlines to suspend key sanctions against Iran . He reluctantly waived sanctions last summer, but this is the first time he'll have to do so since telling Congress in October that the nuclear deal is no longer in the country's national security interest.\nMeanwhile, Congress has not delivered legislation to modify the deal that some lawmakers hoped would be ready by now. That puts the president in the position of having to extend sanctions relief to Iran under the terms of a deal he disavowed three months ago.\nIf Trump refuses to waive the sanctions, it could trigger the collapse of the nuclear deal and put the United States on a diplomatic collision course with France, Germany, China, Russia and the U.K., which also negotiated the accord. It could also disrupt oil supplies from Iran, OPEC's third-largest producer, and potentially free the regime to pursue a nuclear weapon.\nThe administration expects to announce on Friday whether it will continue suspending sanctions. Trump has not yet made a final decision, a National Security Council spokesperson told CNBC.\n'Bleak' prospects for nuclear deal this year Several analysts say Trump is likely to keep the deal alive this week, but the outlook for the accord remains murky beyond this month.\nshow chapters RBC: Geopolitics could play a big factor in oil's direction in 2018 6:42 AM ET Fri, 29 Dec 2017 | 01:17 \"The prognosis for the Iranian nuclear deal in 2018 also looks fairly bleak, and the persistent threat of a U.S. sanctions snapback could curtail foreign investment in the Iranian energy sector and imperil output expansion plans,\" Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said in a recent research note.\nCroft lists a potential collapse of the deal as a key risk to oil markets this year. Since sanctions were lifted in 2016, Iran's oil output has risen by about 1 million barrels per day to about 3.8 million bpd. The loss of Iranian exports would likely push up oil prices.\nRefusing to grant the waivers is Trump's most direct path to blowing up the deal. It would reimpose far-reaching sanctions that could hobble Iran's energy industry, sever it from the international financial system and put a chill on foreign investment into the country.\nRisk consultancy Eurasia Group gives the deal a 55 percent chance of surviving Trump's first term but says it's safe for now. The firm believes Trump will issue the waivers this week but will once again refuse to certify the deal to Congress, which he must do every 90 days under U.S. law. The next deadline for certification is also this week.\nTrump's rejection of the deal in October opened a 60-day window for Congress to restore sanctions under a 2015 law. Rather than take that road, lawmakers began to work on legislation that would address parts of the deal the Trump administration opposes .\nBall in Senate's court That effort by Congress is the main reason Trump won't kill the deal, according to Eurasia Group. The campaign is being led by Sens. Bob Corker , R-Tenn., and Ben Cardin , D-Md., the top lawmakers on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as well as Republican Iran hawk Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas.\n\"Over the next few months, this bill has a decent chance, even though getting Cotton and Cardin together on anything will be tough,\" Eurasia Group Chairman Cliff Kupchan said in a briefing.\nRight now, the plan has not advanced much beyond the framework Corker introduced in October. Corker confirmed last week that no legislation is imminent .\nIt's also uncertain Democrats will accept a pillar of Corker's outline: making the Iran nuclear deal essentially permanent. That would be unacceptable to Iran and faces significant opposition from the other parties to the deal.\nshow chapters Trump: We cannot and will not certify Iran nuclear deal 1:32 PM ET Fri, 13 Oct 2017 | 03:11 Republicans are opposed to the deal in part because the limits that it places on Iran's uranium enrichment and access to equipment are scheduled to expire. Corker's outline calls for eliminating these so-called \"sunset provisions\" and automatically restoring sanctions if Iran comes within one year of being able to make a nuclear weapon.\nRichard Nephew, the lead sanctions expert for the U.S. team that negotiated the nuclear deal, also believes Trump will waive the sanctions this week, but says it's possible he will give senators a deadline, perhaps until the end of the year, to deliver a legislative option.\n\"From a market perspective, such a redline would continue to chill investment in Iran and reduce Iran's incentive to continue to abide by the terms of the\" deal, he said in a briefing for Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, where he is now a senior research scholar.\n\"There may be energy market implications, though probably not in terms of immediate Iranian oil and gas supply,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T15:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T15:58:16.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said after a brief meeting with Scott at the Tallahassee airport that drilling would be \"off the table\" when it comes to waters in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean off Florida.\nThe change of course — just five days after Zinke announced the offshore drilling plan —highlights the political importance of Florida, where President Donald Trump narrowly won the state's 29 electoral votes in the 2016 election and has encouraged Scott to run for Senate.\nThe state is also important economically, with a multi billion-dollar tourism business built on sunshine and miles and miles of white sandy beaches. Zinke said Tuesday that \"Florida is obviously unique\" and that the decision to remove the state came after meetings and discussion with Scott.\nZinke announced plans last week to greatly expand offshore oil drilling from the Atlantic to the Arctic and Pacific oceans, including several possible drilling operations off Florida, where drilling is now blocked.

Bill Nelson said the meeting with Zinke was \"a political stunt orchestrated by the Trump administration to help Rick Scott,\" who Nelson said has long wanted to drill off Florida's coast.\n\"I have spent my entire life fighting to keep oil rigs away from our coasts. But now, suddenly, Secretary Zinke announces plans to drill off Florida's coast and (five) days later agrees to `take Florida off the table'?

Nineteen sales would be off Alaska, 12 in the Gulf of Mexico, nine in the Atlantic and seven in the Pacific, including six off California.\nIndustry groups praised the announcement, the most expansive offshore drilling proposal in decades. The plan follows Trump's executive order in April encouraging more drilling rights in federal waters , part of the administration's strategy to help the U.S. achieve \"energy dominance\" in the global market.\nA coalition of more than 60 environmental groups denounced the plan, saying it would impose \"severe and unacceptable harm\" to America's oceans, coastal economies, public health and marine life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-10T03:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-10T03:44:14.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The Chinese government's 2015 crackdowns on corruption sent the territory's revenues into tailspin, and its 2016 ruling to place limits on ATM withdrawals in Macau weighed heavily on the casino stocks.\nBut after two years of double-digit declines, Macau's gambling numbers have finally started to improve, Cramer said.\nTotal gaming revenues in Macau were only down by 3.3 percent for 2016, a strong outcome after double-digit declines in the first half of the year.\nAlthough Macau's total casino revenues for 2017 haven't been released, Cramer found that after adding them up month by month, the results were up 19 percent versus 2016 in Macanese pataca, the local currency.\n\"More importantly, the cadence of these numbers ... was exactly what you want to see,\" Cramer said. \"Last January they were up 3 percent .

Wynn's Macau revenue grew by over 70 percent in the first nine months of 2017; Las Vegas Sands' grew by 16 percent.\nCramer argued that the growth won't cease even in the face of new overseas ATM withdrawal limits by the Chinese government.\n\"While we need to keep an eye on Macau to make sure last month's deceleration was only a one-time blip, Wynn simply is just not that expensive, even after its monster run,\" he said. \"For those of you who already listened to me on Wynn and bought a position in this one, let it ride.

Swap into Wynn.\"\nFor investors who want less international exposure, Cramer recommended domestic play MGM Resorts , which has exposure to Las Vegas, Washington, D.C. and Atlantic City.\nShares of MGM have gained 37 percent since Cramer recommended it in September of 2016, and its domestic businesses was up 23 percent in the first nine months of 2017.\nThe \"Mad Money\" host added that MGM's stock could get a major lift if the Supreme Court decides to legalize sports gambling outside of Las Vegas.\n\"Here's the bottom line: I believe that Macau can keep rebounding courtesy of this phenomenal global economic expansion, which means that Wynn Resorts might have room to run — and I'd always pick Wynn over Las Vegas Sands,\" Cramer concluded. \"But if you want a domestic casino play with some overseas exposure, MGM has a lot going for it. You know what, though? I'm hard-pressed to pick between MGM and Wynn. They're both that good.\"\nWATCH: Cramer revisits the casino comeback show chapters Cramer gets bullish on casino stocks like Wynn Resorts as Macau prospects improve 20 Hours Ago | 09:40 Questions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

It is understood that in Trump's absence the U.S. secretary of state Rex Tillerson will now cut the ribbon.\nTaking to Twitter, Trump said he thought the Obama administration had sold \"perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for peanuts\", and he slammed the estimated $1.2 billion cost of the new project.\nTweet 1\nFollowing the tweet, many have pointed out that the original decision to move the Embassy away from its Mayfair location was actually during the final weeks of the George W. Bush presidency in 2008.\nAt the time, U.S. state department officials agreed to sell the Grosvenor Square building, in west London, to a Qatari Real Estate company, highlighting a lack of space and security concerns.\nNow, U.S. embassy employees in London will commute to a previously undeveloped site in south west London, bordered by the Thames River to the north and Battersea Power Station to the west.\nThe location may not be to Trump's taste but is he right to call it \"off location\" and what do we know about the new building?\nOff location? Trump may have a point when it comes to a loss of location prestige. The closing U.S. embassy was first sited at Grosvenor Square, Mayfair in 1938. The area houses almost nobody but the uber-rich, with prices for townhouses r egularly advertised at around $25 million .\nBordering Hyde Park and situated moments from Buckingham Palace, the Queen's residence, Mayfair is packed with Georgian era townhouses, gourmet restaurants and exclusive hotels such as Claridge's and The Dorchester\nGetty Images | Pawel Libera Claridges Hotel in London's Mayfair. The Nine Elms site that the new building sits on lies \"south of the river\". That's a red line for many wealthier buyers who deem the Thames as a southern barrier when considering luxury London property.\nWhile relatively central, Nine Elms has for many years been used for industrial purposes, populated by warehouses, scrap yards, garages and a fruit and veg market. Visually it was dominated by a network of railways lines and Battersea Power Station.\nNow, the area is the focus of expensive new residential developments with the new U.S. Embassy at its center. After physical work began in 2013 shops, cafes and restaurants have also sprung up.\nTwo new London Underground stations to serve the area are also under construction and a pedestrian bridge across the Thames to the north has also been agreed.\nMeet the neighbors The U.S. Embassy is considered an \"anchor\" development which has encouraged others to consider the area's potential. The embassy of the Netherlands in London announced in April 2013 that it would relocate to Nine Elms. The Chinese were also expected to move out of their large building in Marylebone and move to Nine Elms though this has not yet materialised.\nClaudio Divizia | iStock / 360 | Getty Images Just to the west of the new embassy is the iconic Battersea Power Station, also being developed under the Nine Elms regeneration.\nThe project, financed by a Malaysian consortium, received a big boost to its reputation when Apple said it would move its 1,400 London-based staff there.\nPop veteran Sting and celebrity survival expert Bear Grylls are among the most high-profile people to have committed to apartments in the area.\nWhat is the new building all about?

He started in high-yield bonds and went on during the internet boom to turn a million dollars in patent acquisitions into a portfolio of software intellectual property worth $150 million.\nErich Spangenberg Erich Spangenberg, founder of IPwe, made a fortune amassing tech patents during the software boom. Attacked by some as a patent troll for the $150 million he made, he now wants to bring the entire patent world into the 21st century, using AI and the blockchain. By his own account, he didn't make his IP fortune by not being aggressive. But Spangenberg describes his latest, and what he thinks will be the biggest and longest-lasting investing idea he has ever had, as something he stumbled into as a result of a friend convincing him to buy bitcoin.\n\"When I stumbled into it, I didn't know it was enabled by the blockchain,\" he recalled. \"I made a lot in finance and what I recognized was how incredible inefficiencies create arbitrage opportunities. I realized blockchain was significant, and the more I thought about it, the more it seemed so. I jumped all over it.\"\nSpangenberg — who over the years has been on the receiving end of \"troll\" criticism for his patent fortune — recently pursued a more interesting path involving use of his patent knowledge to target what many of the populist-minded would judge to be an unfair stranglehold over pricing.\nHe teamed with hedge fund manager Kyle Bass to challenge the patents of pharmaceutical companies with high drug prices while shorting their stocks. But Spangenberg says he knew when he started with Bass that the drug patent effort wouldn't hold his interest for the rest of his life. Spangenberg was also going through a divorce at the time. \"I had time to think about a lot of things,\" he said. Including exactly where he had made his millions and just how inefficient the patent world itself had become in allowing a few specialist niches to receive most of the riches.\n\"I started thinking about the space I had been screwing around in, the patents,\" Spangenberg said. \"There are roughly 200 national patent offices globally, and for 99.9 percent — even when we know who owns the patents — it is so hard to figure out anything. There's not a whole lot of people positioned to say, 'Here is where it's screwed up.' I played in arbitrage and the troll business, and inefficiency permitted me to make a fortune. We should eliminate that and now make money another way.\"\nHis new firm, IPwe , is attacking two issues critical to what is really innovation's own infrastructure: the intellectual property space. IPwe is creating a blockchain -based registry to tackle the lack of access to good information on patent transactions. And it is using machine-learning algorithms to better evaluate patent validity and worth. Specialized investments in the patent asset class exist today, but the end goal of IPwe is to turn the opaque and fragmented world of patents and patent transactions into a broad asset class that can attract much more interest from the world's top institutional investors, as an example, insurance companies looking for pools of non-traditional investments that can generate significant returns.\nNear $200 billion traded in patents many fear but few understand In recent years the value of patents that have been monetized through acquisitions or licensing has neared $200 billion, and yet that represents a tiny portion of all patent grants. The World Intellectual Property Organization has estimated $180 billion in annual patent value derived from 2 percent of all patents. That's an arbitrage opportunity that Spangenberg thinks will disrupt the intermediaries who today benefit the most from the opaque way the patent economy is run: primarily, patent lawyers. The end goal is to turn what has been a limited asset class, where a vast majority of profits go to a narrow group of specialists, into a major asset class receiving allocations from a broad set of investors.\nMark Schankerman, a professor at the London School of Economics, who first met Spangenberg after he donated some of his patent fortune to fund work in entrepreneurship at the London school, said patent trolls and their lawyers play a role in limiting the patent economy, especially in cases where they are demanding too much for IP — \"the \"holdups,\" as he called them. But patent quality is also a huge issue.\n\"That's the other big elephant in the room. ... The vast majority of patents applied for are low quality,\" Schankerman said. \"A lot just should have never been patented, and no one wants the damn stuff.\"\nHis research on U.S. patent litigation estimates that as much as 75 percent to 80 percent of patents are junk. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, meanwhile, is able to screen out, at best, one-third of the patent applications that shouldn't get through. He said survey work on patent value, while less pessimistic than his own research, still shows as much as 40 percent of patents as being overvalued.\n\"Illusive patent quality will improve as a result of inventors, R&D and patent examiners having better tools. We will make more if there are more quality patents. We are capitalists at the end of the day — just creative on how we get there.\" -Eric Spangenberg, co-founder of IPwe Even if 90 percent of patents are worthless, that leaves 10 percent to transact, already five times the current level that is in play, based on the World Intellectual Property data. He doesn't think the math will be linear, but for the sake of an example, that's $900 billion — 5 x $180 billion. \"Even 2x would still be significant. Our bet is that this number is closer to 20 percent,\" Spangenberg said.\nHe believes the critical problem is not on the large pool of overvalued patents on the output side — patent offices issue patents on what is applied for, but on the input side. \"Over time the illusive patent quality will improve as a result of inventors, R&D and patent examiners having better tools. We will make more if there are more quality patents. We are capitalists at the end of the day — just creative on how we get there.\"\nArtificial intelligence algorithms can identify what is left in the world of intellectual property worth patenting. \"We can tell you that, and that will make patents better,\" Spangenberg said.\nIPwe is working with the computer science team at the University of Minnesota, led by Professor George Karypis, which has previously provided patent evaluation technology to clients of IP Navigation Group, a previous company founded by Spangenberg.\n\"Erich has a grand vision,\" Karypis said. \"He always has one. We have the system in place to cover a large chunk of IP, both in terms of scale and analysis ... on all U.S. and European patents and a good chunk of Chinese IP.\"\nMany A.I. start-ups see a patent world ripe for reevaluation The fundamental problems that algorithms can solve in the IP space relate to prior art search — how to know if a patent application is already covered by existing patents — and where \"white space\" exists in the patent system — how much room is left to patent an idea based on what has already been covered by exis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T17:26:57.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

This flat line of human capital means less output and persistently lower economic growth.\nWhile the economic need to add workers to our population is unquestionable, the two potential sources of workers do carry different costs and considerations.\n\"Canada plans to accept close to one million immigrants in just the next three years – almost 60 percent of whom will come through employment-based channels. Compare that to only 14 percent of immigrants currently coming into the U.S. through employment-based programs.\" Raising and educating children is expensive. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that American households spend an average of around $260,000 raising a child to the age of 17. Add to that the public cost of educating a child through age 17, which the National Center for Education Statistics prices at more than $11,000, per pupil, per year. This means the combined public and private spending to raise the average native-born child through age 17 reaches just over $400,000.\nAn educated, working-age immigrant, on the other hand, carries no such cost for the U.S.\nRecent analysis by the Committee for Economic Development indicates that adding just 100,000 working-age immigrants per year provides an infusion of human capital that would cost $47 billion to obtain through education and child rearing spending on native-born workers.\nCombined with ready-to-work immigrants who come to the U.S. with a bachelor's degree in hand, foreign-born workers provide a value of human capital to our economy worth $314 billion per year, equivalent to 1.9 percent of GDP.\nCurrent law does encourage some immigration based on skills and employment, but the parameters of these programs are both outdated and insufficient to meet workforce needs.\nH-1B admissions, for example, are dominated by computer programmers, software developers and others in computer-related occupations – fields where researchers do not anticipate labor shortages due to limited retirements and large numbers of new entrants in those jobs.\nMeanwhile, current law makes it difficult for foreign-born nurses and home health aides – fields that face significant worker shortages – to come to the U.S.\nThe Administration and Congress might look to our neighbors in Canada for ideas about growing our labor force through smart immigration increases. In Canada, the native-born labor force is declining in size.\nCanada plans to accept close to one million immigrants in just the next three years – nearly three percent of their total population – almost 60 percent of whom will come through employment-based channels. Compare that to only 14 percent of immigrants currently coming into the U.S. through employment-based programs.\nCanada also factors geography into their immigration policy. Knowing that different provinces have different labor shortage risks, Canadian lawmakers have allowed individual provinces to select immigration criteria to meet their specific needs.\nHere in the U.S., states should have the same flexibility. For example, a state like Maine – with large numbers of 50-to-60-year-old residents relative to the number of young people about to enter the workforce – has very different immigration needs when compared to a state like Utah, which has a relatively young population.\nBeing mindful of geography can also address concerns around the potential for downward pressure on wages for native-born workers. If workers come into the states where they are needed most, the likelihood of negative impact on the native-born labor force is reduced. When managed strategically, immigration creates additional consumer demand, which is good news for all workers.\nSignificantly raising the level of employment-based visa limits, and allowing each state to tailor its intake according to their workforce needs, would allow the U.S. economy to efficiently capture the employment-ready, educated workers we need for more robust economic growth.\nReforming the nation's immigration system by attracting educated, working-age people who will add to the American economy is also the kind of sound policy deal on which the Administration and Congress should agree. It will improve economic growth by boosting both the quality and quantity of available workers without reducing opportunities for native-born workers: An artful deal, based on shared goals.\nCommentary by Steve Odland, the CEO of the Committee for Economic Development and former CEO of Office Depot and AutoZone.

In exchange for preserving the Obama-era protections for undocumented immigrants who were brought the the United States as children, the White House wants Congress to fund more border security measures and cancel two popular immigration programs, the diversity visa lottery and preferential family migration. \n\"We're at a deal, so we'll be talking to the White House about that and I hope we can move forward with it,\" Flake told reporters Thursday. \"It's the only game in town.

If these figures hold after revisions, they represent the best one-two punch of growth since the second and third quarters of 2014, when the economy grew at annual rates of 4.6 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively.\nSo, things are off to a good start, and the president and his supporters are understandably excited.\nThe economy barely grew at 1.5 percent during 2016, only 1.2 percent during the first quarter of 2017 and 2.2 percent since the end of the great recession. Two consecutive quarters of growth at rates at which President Trump and his team insist are sustainable on the condition that his policies are fully implemented are a great segway to the wonderful possibilities ahead.\nBut the team, especially in the Department of Commerce, the U.S. Trade Representative's Office, and the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, should look at the following:\nWhen it came to aggregated economic activity purely from within the U.S., or \"real final sales to domestic purchasers\" including the government, the third quarter growth rate was only 1.9 percent on an annualized basis. This was considerably slower than the 2.6 percent pace of the second quarter and the 2.4 percent pace of the first quarter, and it was approximately 0.2 percent lower than the average growth rate since the end of the great recession.\nSo, if overall economic growth and that of purely domestic demand have been moving in-step since mid-2009 (both roughly 2.15 percent), but that of domestic demand has weakened since the beginning of 2017, then what explains the pickup in overall growth that we are experiencing today? Two factors: inventory accumulation and international trade.\nInventory accumulation is wildly volatile from quarter to quarter. While a big buildup like the one during the third quarter can represent confidence on the part of businesses for future orders, they can also represent a short-term miscalculation of present demand that would have to be unwound in the future. We will have to wait and see on that point.\nInternational trade however, is an entirely different animal. Combined exports and imports represented roughly 27 percent of GDP in the third quarter and have averaged 28.5 percent over the past five years. Moreover, it has been in a steady uptrend since the early 1970s, when it represented barely 10 percent of U.S. overall economic activity.\nTrade was a net positive contributor to economic growth in five of the six quarters through the first three quarters of 2017, and barring a significant slowdown in the final three months of 2017, it is likely to be additive for the whole year, and for the first time since 2013.\nIn fact, 2017 could be the strongest year for net exports contributions to growth since 2009 and one of the best in the last 30 non-recessionary years.\nAnd all of this happened with the backdrop of the U.S. withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, its potential withdrawals from the North American Free Trade Agreement and KORUS (a free trade agreement with South Korea), and a probable indefinite hold on many of the free-trade deals in the works. Just imagine what growth could have been if such dark clouds were not on the horizon of possibilities? An economic growth profile of 3.0 percent even in the short-run will likely be unattainable without positive contributions from trade.\nThe message should be clear to the president, Secretary Wilbur Ross, Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, and Director Peter Navarro. Tame the rhetoric around protectionism and don't rock the boat on trade if you want to be anywhere near your 3.0 percent growth target.\nArdavan Mobasheri, is Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer of ACIMA Private Wealth and Adjunct Professor at the Robins School of Business at the University of Richmond.

Worth almost $70 million according to Forbes, his namesake television show catapulted the funny man to superstardom — but Seinfeld, 63, built his reputation step by step, joke by joke.\nIn a conversation with David Remnick for The New Yorker Radio Hour , Seinfeld talks about his very first joke, which he also reveals in his new Netflix series, \" Jerry before Seinfeld .\"\n\"So, I am left handed. Left-handed people do not like that the word left is so often associated with negative things. Left feet. Left-handed compliment. 'What are we having for dinner? Leftovers.' You go to a party there is nobody there. 'Where did everybody go?' 'They left!'\"\n\"That was it, that was my first joke,\" Seinfeld says.\n\n\"It just occurred to me that all these left words are negative. Left-handed compliment. You know, you hear that and then I thought, 'Well that is weird. Why are they putting that on us?' And, 'they left' — and so that was the joke.\"\nThe pacing is important, he says: \"The rhythm is 90 percent of that joke.\"\nThe entire podcast is embedded below:\nSeinfeld discovered his love for comedy early in life. He was obsessed.\n\"I was not a very social kid, but I did get a TV in my room — when my parents got a new TV, I got them to give me the old TV,\" he tells Remnick. \"I had a TV in my room and I never came out of the room again.\"\nHe watched comedy shows and movies and listened to comedians' records. \"I just inhaled this stuff. I just couldn't get enough of it.\"\nThough he knew at a young age he loved comedy, Seinfeld says he didn't know he would be successful — but that didn't stop him. And his obsessive determination, despite his lack of confidence, is exactly how he knew he had found his passion.\n\"The truth is I really didn't think that I could and I didn't really care whether I could or I couldn't. I just got to this point where I was so in love with it that I just decided, 'What's the difference? What's the difference?' It seemed much more important to do the thing you want to do than success or failure,\" says Seinfeld.\n\n\"This was 1975 you know, there was still a little bit of the vapors of the 60s where you did what you believed in. It wasn't a success culture. It was more of a soul culture,\" Seinfeld says.\nIt was that dedication that sustained Seinfeld through the early struggles of building a comedy career. Remick asked Seinfeld whether being a young comedian requires a remarkably thick skin.\n\"Well, yes it does,\" he says. \"It does unless you just know you can't leave this world. You just can't. So it doesn't matter how hard it is or how much pain there may be. You know you have no choice. You know you have found your thing if you are lucky in life. If you find your thing.\" \n\"This is my thing,\" he says. \"I know how to do this. I am good at this.\"\nSee also: \nBillionaire Richard Branson: This simple trick is the best way to come up with an idea for a successful business \nTony Robbins: This is the difference between people who stick to their New Year's resolutions and those who don't \nMark Cuban: If I lost everything and had to start over, here's what I would do \nshow chapters Mark Cuban: If I lost everything and had to start over, here's what I would do      9:22 AM ET Fri, 24 March 2017 | 00:47 Like this story?

That holding grew to be worth more than $1 billion in December 2017 as the price of one coin surpassed $11,700. \nThat month, The New York Times reported the twins' bitcoin holdings were worth about $1.3 billion and that they held an additional $350 million in other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. (December saw wild swings in the price of bitcoin, at one point topping $19,000 trading on the Coinbase exchange. Friday, Bitcoin was trading near $13,500, according to Coinbase. ) \nWhile other early cryptocurrency investors are splurging on things like Lamborghinis , though, the Winklevoss brothers are managing their wealth differently. \n\"While they both have apartments in downtown Manhattan, they say they live relatively spartan lives with few luxuries,\" The Times' Nathaniel Popper reports. \"Cameron drives an old S.U.V.; Tyler doesn't have a car at all.\" Getty Images Cameron Winklevoss, left, and Tyler Winklevoss \nTheir mentality appears to be focused on investing rather than spending. \"Long term, directionally, it is a multitrillion-dollar asset — I don't know how long it takes to get there,\" Cameron Winklevoss tells CNBC. They're willing to be patient. As Cameron wrote in a 2013 Reddit, Ask Me Anything post , \"I'm in this for the long-haul.\" \nThe Times reports Cameron and Tyler did sell a portion of their coins to launch Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange on which people can buy and sell bitcoin, but they have no other plans to sell their stake. A representative for Winklevoss Capital, the brothers investment firm, declined to comment. \nWhether or not you're getting rich off of crypto, there is a good lesson you can take away from the Winklevoss twins: Money you don't spend on luxuries like fancy cars can be invested, and that lets it keep growing over time. \nAs 'Shark Tank' investor Kevin O'Leary puts it in a conversation with CNBC Make It , \"The truth is, there is a lot of crap you don't need.\" \n\"Anytime I pick up something I'm going to buy, I say to myself, 'Do I really need this?'\" O'Leary explains. \"Because if I don't buy it, the money is going to be invested and make money every year for me while I'm sleeping.\" \nBitcoin skeptics like Warren Buffett, who tells CNBC \"almost with certainty\" that cryptocurrencies \" will come to a bad ending ,\" recommend investing in low-cost index funds, a way to cheaply hold diverse positions in the largest companies in the stock market. \n\"Consistently buy an S&P 500 low-cost index fund,\" Warren Buffett tells CNBC's On The Money. \"I think it's the thing that makes the most sense practically all of the time.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T22:41:24.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

More gross profit gives Amazon more flexibility to invest in its operations, which allows it to spend more in new areas like international, video, and Alexa. \"We believe continued strength in high margin revenue streams will start to outgrow investments in Video, salesforce, Alexa, and fulfillment centers,\" the note said. Continued strong top-line growth: The company's revenue growth has bounced back to mid-to-high 20 percent in the last two years from closer to 20 percent growth in 2015. That's largely driven by its Prime member growth, Echo device sales, and the broader consumer shift to online shopping. \"Investments will result in increased earnings and cashflow in out years and lead to positive estimate revisions,\" the note said. Growth in under-penetrated and large markets: Amazon will continue to move into new markets, as it did with the acquisition of Whole Foods last year that immediately made the company a major presence the in brick-and-mortar grocery market. \"We see Amazon's immediate addressable US market as $2.5 trillion, but this could expand to $5 trillion if it expands into more markets,\" the note said. \nUnder its $2,000 per share \"bull case\" scenario, which would get Amazon to the $1 trillion market cap milestone, Morgan Stanley estimates the core retail business to be worth $600 billion and the AWS cloud $273 billion. It forecasts Amazon's advertising business to get to $55 billion, while its subscription business would become worth $69 billion.

Instead he turned it into a s---hole.\nCarlos Barria | Reuters President Donald Trump attends a signing ceremony for the Interdict Act into law, to provide Customs and Border Protection agents with the latest screening technology on the fight against the opioid crisis, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington D.C. In an alternate reality, Trump would have luxuriated with fellow Republicans in a warm bath of positive news. Walmart just announced a higher minimum wage and bonuses, joining a parade of other companies doling out cash to workers and crediting the GOP tax plan. A new poll showed rising faith in the U.S. economy. Blackrock CEO Larry Fink told CNBC the new lower tax rate would boost the U.S. over Mexico.\nAll this should be have been music to Trumpian ears and an opportunity to do what senior West Wing staff are regularly begging the president to do: Stay on a positive message about bigger paychecks and faster economic growth.\nAdministration officials privately say the key to reversing Trump's dismal approval rating and the GOP's awful generic ballot numbers against Democrats is to get people to credit them for improving economic conditions.\nThe Quinnipiac poll showed a plurality of Americans still credit the Obama administration for the state of the economy. But with a signature piece of legislation now enacted and companies beginning to respond, Republicans have a decent case to make that they should start to get the credit.\nEven a marginally functional chief executive could execute on this strategy. Trump can't. The president started his day on Thursday live tweeting \"Fox & Friends\" and in the span of a few minutes rebuked his own administration's policy on domestic surveillance and then had to reverse himself.\nBut things really blew up later in the day when at a private meeting with lawmakers, Trump reportedly asked why the U.S. has to accept immigrants from \"s---hole\" countries, an apparent reference to Haiti and some African nations. He also reportedly said: \"Why do we want people from Haiti here?\"\nThe comments blew up on social media and cable television, completely wiping out news about Walmart and the economy. It did not end there.\nTrump also gave a lengthy and bizarre interview to The Wall Street Journal in which he suggested the market might go up if he pulled out of NAFTA, rambled about a Mexican wall with windows, suggested he might have secretly met Kim Jong Un and boasted about how he is the smartest and best at pretty much everything.\nPerhaps sensing the interview was going off the rails, a White House staffer present for the discussion kept trying to get Trump out of the room.\nThe president could have steered back on message on Friday, hoping the \"s---hole\" controversy would die out. But of course he didn't. He kept it going at least another day by tweeting a denial.\n\"The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA!\"\nHe added: \"Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said \"take them out.\" Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings - unfortunately, no trust!\"\nHe did this despite the White House not denying any of the comments on Thursday and multiple news organizations confirming them. Sen. Dick Durbin , D-Ill., who was present for the remarks, rebuked Trump's denial on Friday: \"It's not true. He said those hateful things, and he said them repeatedly.\"\nAll this guarantees that news and social media feeds over the weekend will obsess and argue over whether Trump really said racist and disgusting things. And a bunch of news on the economy that might actually help the president and the GOP will get dumped down the s---hole.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T17:59:22.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The previous low was held by Bill Clinton , whose first-year average stood 10 points higher than Trump's, at 49 percent.\nRecent surveys show most Americans view Trump as a divisive figure and even question his fitness for office. One relative bright spot for Trump is his handling of the economy, though even there his ratings are not as high as might be expected given a relatively strong economy.\nWhat the polls show about how Americans view their president a year into his term:\nUnusual unpopularity Trump's current approval rating in Gallup's weekly poll is comparable to his average rating, standing at just 38 percent, with 57 percent saying they disapprove.\nThe persistence of Trump's first-year blues is unprecedented for a president so early in his term. Americans usually give their new presidents the benefit of the doubt, but Trump's \"honeymoon period,\" to the extent he had one, saw his approval rating only as high as 45 percent.\nSince then, Trump has spent more time under 40 percent than any other first-year president.\nPresidents have recovered from periods of low popularity before. For example, Clinton's rating fell to just 37 percent in June 1993 before quickly regaining ground, and he went on to win re-election. Harry S. Truman held the approval of less than 40 percent of Americans for significant chunks of his first term and was also re-elected. He went on to set Gallup's lowest-ever approval mark, at just 22 percent in 1952.\nTrump's lowest point in Gallup's weekly polling — 35 percent — remains higher than those of several earlier presidents. Truman, Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter all had their ratings dip under 30 percent.\nStrong suits There aren't many bright spots for Trump, but there are some. For one, most Republicans continue to approve of him — 83 percent of registered voters who identify as Republicans, according to a recent Quinnipiac poll.\nThe same poll found that most voters overall find Trump to be intelligent and a strong person.\nAnd positive ratings for Trump's handling of the economy have tended to run higher than his overall job ratings.\nIn a December poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, Trump's rating on handling the economy was 8 percentage points higher than his overall approval, though even that stood at just 40 percent in the survey, which was a particularly negative one for Trump.\nIn the Quinnipiac poll, voters were more likely to say Trump is helping the economy than hurting it, 37 percent to 29 percent. On the other hand, more said President Barack Obama deserves the credit than Trump does, 49 percent to 40 percent.\nOn the issues Aside from the economy, surveys have suggested few policy bright spots for Trump.\nHealth care has been a consistent low point. Seven in 10 Americans in the December AP-NORC poll said they disapproved of Trump's handling of the issue, even as 85 percent called the issue very important to them personally.\nIn another AP-NORC poll conducted late in 2017, just 23 percent of Americans said he has kept the promises he made while running for president, while 30 percent said he's tried and failed and 45 percent said he has not done so at all. More than half said the country is worse off since Trump became president.\nThat poll was conducted before the passage of a tax bill that Trump signed into law in late December, but there's little sign that the law will have an immediate positive impact. A Gallup poll conducted in January found that just 33 percent of Americans approved of the legislation.\nCharacter concerns But it may be character more than policy that's driving negative opinions of Trump. In the January poll by Quinnipiac University, most voters said Trump is not level-headed, honest or even fit to serve as president.\nAnd the AP-NORC poll conducted in December found that two-thirds of Americans thought the country has become even more divided as a result of Trump's presidency.\nIn a July Gallup poll that asked those who disapproved of Trump for their reasons why, most cited his personality or character over issues, policies or overall job performance. That stood in stark contrast to Gallup's polling on Obama in 2009 and George W. Bush in 2001, when far fewer cited such concerns about personality or character as reasons for their negative opinions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T18:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T18:55:15.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Still, there's one question about money that always drives her crazy, she writes in a recent blog post: \"Would I be happier if I had more?\" \n\"I am always floored … when I am talking to groups and I get this question. I try not to get too worked up,\" she says, \"but any of you, who have come to hear me speak, know this when I get a bit animated. \n\"This way of thinking makes me crazy.\" \nMoney alone, she says, will not make you happy. \"Yes, you need to have enough money to pay your basic living costs . But making more money, having more money than that, does not guarantee you will be happier. I know plenty of very wealthy people. They are so not happy .\" show chapters 9:20 AM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 | 00:53 \nStudies back up that claim . Experts say that happiness only increases with wealth up to a point : The correlation peaks when you earn $75,000 per year. \"The difference the marginal dollar makes in reducing negative emotions starts to fall off around $70,000, is very low by $160,000 and hits zero around $200,000,\" reports CNBC . \nA recent review from the Harvard Business School asked more than 4,000 millionaires to rank their life satisfaction and happiness. Its findings: Even the super-rich aren't always satisfied. \nThat may be because \"what matters for your well-being is what you're doing with the minutes and days of your life,\" not necessarily how much money you have,\" Elizabeth Dunn, a psychology professor at the University of British Columbia, tells CNBC Make It . \n\"If you have a lot of money and a lot of nice stuff, but you're spending your time doing things that you dislike, then your minute-to-minute happiness and overall happiness is likely to be pretty low.\" show chapters 11:50 AM ET Wed, 28 June 2017 | 01:04 \nBerkshire Hathaway chairman and chief executive officer Warren Buffett, whose net worth is nearing $90 billion, agrees . \n\"I can buy anything, basically,\" Buffett said on PBS Newshour. \"I have been on 400-foot yachts, and I have ... lived the life a little bit with people that have 10 homes and everything.\" Yet Buffett still lives in the same house he bought in 1958. And \"for me,\" he says, \"it's because it's got memories, and people come back, and all that sort of thing.\" \nThere are ways you can strive for happiness and financial success at the same time. For instance, a study of more than 195,000 American workers shows that making friends at work can not only make you happier, it can also make you a better employee. \nAnd building \" rich relationships ,\" like the one Buffett and longtime friend Bill Gates have shared for years, with people you admire who can mentor or encourage you, can help you reach personal, professional and financial goals. \nOverall, though, as Orman writes, happiness doesn't come from making or having money. Instead, it's \"waiting for you in the time you spend with loved ones. [It] comes from celebrating what you have today, and not getting all worked up about what you don't have.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T21:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T21:10:53.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

But the political foundation of Donald Trump 's presidency was racial grievance. \nTrump has repeatedly appealed to unhappy whites with his denunciation of Mexican immigrants, his defense of white supremacist protesters, and his attacks on black athletes protesting for racial justice. Thursday's Oval Office excoriation of \"s---hole countries\" in Africa and the Caribbean simply followed that pattern . (Trump appeared to deny making the comment on Friday, although some senators in the room at the time pushed back against him ). \nAs a candidate and as president, Trump has sounded plenty of race-neutral themes, including the call for tax cuts that culminated in landmark legislation last month. But some political science research has shown that his blunt race-tinged messages were the reason he vaulted past an experienced lineup of rivals to win the 2016 Republican nomination and then the White House. \nEmily Ekins, director of polling at the libertarian Cato Institute, identified five groups of Trump voters as part of a broader Democracy Fund study of the 2016 election. Key to his emergence, she concluded, was the 20 percent segment she called \"preservationists,\" who stood out for their \"nativist and ethno-cultural conception of American identity.\" \n\"American Preservationists comprise the core Trump constituency that propelled him to victory in the early Republican primaries,\" Ekins wrote. \nShe characterized them as having low levels of education, income and political information, watching lots of television, and offering strong professions of Christian faith combined with infrequent church attendance. With many of them disabled and on Medicaid, they display hostility toward Wall Street, support for redistribution of wealth, and concern about their government retirement benefits. \nTheir economic views help explain Trump's pledge not to touch Social Security and Medicare benefits. Their social views explain where they found kinship with him. \n\"They are far more likely to have a strong sense of their own racial identity,\" Ekins wrote. \"They take the most restrictionist approach to immigration – staunchly opposing not just illegal but legal immigration as well, and intensely supporting a temporary Muslim travel ban. \n\"They feel the greatest amount of angst over race relations. They believe that anti-white discrimination is as pervasive as other forms of discrimination.\" \nIn some ways, the emergence of a Republican nominee with Trump's instincts and support base represents the logical conclusion to decades of political evolution in a steadily diversifying nation. \nAs late as 1960, Republican candidate Richard Nixon drew a third of the black vote. But after Democratic president Lyndon Johnson won enactment of civil rights legislation over the opposition of Republican rival Barry Goldwater in 1964, voting patterns changed. \nNo Republican has reached 20 percent of the black vote since; no Democrat has carried a majority of whites. The \"Solid South,\" once controlled by Democratic segregationists rooted in the old Confederacy, switched parties to become a Republican redoubt. \nAn evolution toward social tolerance among younger Americans, on issues including sexuality as well as race, points toward diminished relevance of identity divisions over the long run. But anxiousness among whites – who have shrunk to 70 percent of the electorate from over 90 percent in the 1960s – will offer a tempting target for Trump-like Republicans as America becomes a majority-minority nation over the next three decades. \n\"By making questions of national identity more salient, Donald Trump succeeded in winning over 'populists' who had previously voted for Democrats,\" analyst Lee Drutman wrote in another part of the Democracy Fund study. \nTrump's success, which accelerated pre-existing trends, has given Republicans more blue-collar support and Democrats more allies among better-educated, more affluent suburbanites. That blurs some historic partisan splits over economics, while sharpening those the president continues to inflame. \n\"The primary conflict structuring the two parties,\" Drutman observed, \"involves questions of national identity, race and morality.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T23:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T23:23:20.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The \"Greyball\" software identified regulators who were trying to hail a ride in an attempt to collect evidence of local law-breaking. Those rides would be canceled or never arrive. It has also been reported that the Justice Department was investigating whether Uber illegally used software to track drivers of its rival Lyft.\nBloomberg reported that authorities in Montreal were seeking evidence in May 2015 that Uber had violated tax laws. Uber's use of Ripley meant they didn't get any information, but Uber cooperated with a second search warrant and agreed to collect provincial taxes for each ride, Bloomberg said.\nEnsign said the company shut down Ripley in 2016 because it didn't work well.\nShe said Uber now has a tool called ULocker that can remotely lock and encrypt devices. Ensign could not immediately say if Uber has used that to protect data from law enforcement as well. But she said Uber's guidance to employees bars use of the tool where it isn't legal.\nIn a statement, Uber said this security tool is similar to those used by other companies and gives them a way to block access to data when an employee loses a device. The company said its policy is to cooperate with \"all valid searches and requests for data.\"\nThe ride-hailing service had a scandal-ridden 2017 that included lawsuits, government probes, the revelation of a significant sexual-harassment problem and the disclosure of a cover-up of a hack that stole personal information of 57 million passengers and 600,000 drivers.

David Paul Morris—Bloomberg via Getty Images By Ashwin Rodrigues 10:14 PM EST \nAt CES 2018, the “Global Stage for Innovation,” the usual pageantry and promises of technology were abundant. Washing machines will talk to your smartwatch . Computer chip companies will make better computer chips . But amidst the flashing lights of the Las Vegas strip, and the blaring beeps, bloops, and push notifications on the trade show floor, one company stood out. \nThe product? A VR headset. But this one doesn’t just augment reality, it transcends time. \nThe company behind the headset, Despairly, claims to offer the world’s first device that seamlessly simulates the future. The headset gives the user a glimpse into a world of total darkness, devoid of any visual or auditory stimulation whatsoever. \nWe got some face time with the CEO of Despairly, Graham Wolfe, to understand his inspiration behind one of the most interesting products we’ve seen at CES 2018. \n“I mean, that’s where we’re headed, right? We’re just the messengers. You can only move so fast, and break so many things, before there’s complete darkness,” said Wolfe, as part of a larger conversation that was mostly a huge bummer. \n“The truth exists, whether you see it or not. So you might as well check it out. Or don’t. It doesn’t matter.” \nRetailing for $450, a view into the future does not come cheap. Wolfe justifies this price point in a refreshingly blunt manner. “Did you hear how we’ve described it? If you want to buy this thing, you don’t deserve to have money. $450 is a steal. We’re stealing $450 from you.” \nTo confirm the accuracy of this product, we spoke to a Dr. Karen Filmore, a climate scientist at NASA. “Yep,” Dr. Filmore told us. “If this device is supposed to provide a glimpse into future 10 to 15 years from now, it’s absolutely correct. Absolute nothingness.” \nWe were given a test version of the headset during the show, and can confirm: it’s the real deal. The future is a colorless void, where sound can neither be created nor heard. But will it pair with the Apple Watch? We’re not sure. \nWolfe answered our question with a question. “Why would you even want to do that?” he asked. “What could that possibly accomplish?” \nA spokesperson followed up via email to confirm the Despairly headset will support multiple smartwatch integrations. The spokesperson also apologized for the CEO’s erratic behavior, which they attributed to raw water withdrawals he’d been experiencing since landing in Las Vegas. \nThe Despairly will be sold at several online retailers starting in March 2018. The team tells us they might add an option to “look at a beach or something,” though they cannot guarantee there will be actual beaches in the future. \nAt press time, as CES attendees recovered from a two-hour complete blackout on the trade show floor , Wolfe handed out business cards and assured reporters that from here on out, it would only get worse.

When investors think they can't get into trouble, they usually do,\" Wien said Wednesday on CNBC's \" Trading Nation .\" \"We're vulnerable to a correction.\" \nWien's comments came as stocks failed to extend their six-day win streak. The Dow , S&P 500 and Nasdaq all closed lower for the first time this year. Bond yields set another round of multiyear highs — which could indicate inflation could emerge as a headwind. \n\"The market needs to have some kind of correction. There are some excesses in it. So I fully expect it to happen,\" he said. \nBut Wien, who detects frothiness among technology stocks in particular, predicts the markets would recover quickly. \n\"The year will end higher than it started no matter what happens along the way,\" he said, adding that he'd \"absolutely buy\" stocks on a correction because underlying fundamentals remain strong. \nUltimately, he sees the S&P 500 in 2018 ending 9 percent higher than current levels as long as the 10-year Treasury yield stays below 3 percent. \nFor now, Wien is shifting his investment strategy to the overseas markets. \n\"India is still attractive. I think Japan is still attractive,\" Wien said.

But it has maintained its $67 ceiling of resistance for months — a level Moreno doesn't think will hold for much longer.\nMoreno pointed to the chart's stochastic oscillator, a tool that measures whether a stock is overbought or oversold.\n\"The oscillator just recently ... crossed above the center line. When it does that, Moreno says that's a sign that the stock is ready to gallop — important since it's only a buck away from the ceiling of resistance,\" Cramer said. \"This four-month period of consolidation, which has been torture, is like a coiled spring, he says, ready to propel the stock higher.\"\nMoreno had a similar outlook for Electronic Arts, which produces Battlefield, The Sims and a host of licensed sports games including FIFA.\n\nLike Activision, Electronic Arts' stock had been consolidating for months before forming a cup-and-handle pattern in December under its $110 ceiling of resistance.\nBut even though the stock has trumped its ceiling, closing Wednesday at $112.25, its trajectory remains murky. While its relative strength index, a key momentum indicator, has been trending higher, its accumulation/distribution line, a tool that measures money flow, has stayed flat.\n\"This is going to need to pick up before Moreno will really believe that EA is ready to run, but once it does, he thinks the stock could have a ton of upside,\" Cramer said.\nSo as the gaming industry continues its seemingly unstoppable uptrend in 2018, Cramer and Moreno expect the rising tide to lift these boats.\n\"The video game space remains one of the hottest secular growth groups around, and I think these stocks have more room to run in 2018, including Take-Two Interactive,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"But the charts ... suggest that Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard could end up giving you better performance this year as they start to play catch-up to this tremendous out-performer run by Strauss Zelnick .\"\nWATCH: Cramer's charts bullish for video game names show chapters Cramer's charts show video game stocks like Take-Two have more room to run      17 Hours Ago | 10:46 Questions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

A student who, you know, leans very much in one direction.\" \nIf a student can demonstrate that they are extremely talented in a specific area, then a college is more likely to forgive their flaws explains Kim. \"Perhaps if a student is a star in mathematics but not necessarily the strongest writer, we'll give them the benefit of the doubt in that way,\" she says. Courtesy of Logic Prep Grace Kim \nThis preference for specific strengths rather than general excellence is rooted in an interest in building a class of students with varied perspectives and passions . \"They are looking for a well-rounded class even if not each individual student is well-rounded,\" says Kim. \n\"You can think of it like a dinner party. You want to invite people to the party who you know are going to add value to the conversation, people who are going to bring their perspectives and experiences and enrich the dining experience for the people around them,\" she says. \"People who are going to ask interesting questions and really are curious to get to know about the experiences and stories of the people around that dinner table.\" \n\"If you want to get invited to that party, the host has to think that you will be contributing something meaningful,\" she says.

The following month Apple launched its Airpods after dispensing with the plug-in for jack cables in its iPhone 7. \nGN’s original earphones, tailored for athletes with features to track progress and measure heart rate, sold for $370, twice as much as Apple’s equivalent. \n“Apple has helped develop this market with great speed but now we’re launching a new generation,” Svendsen-Tune said, speaking ahead of the launch of the product at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. \nIn the first half of 2017 around 900,000 wireless headphone units were sold in the U.S. alone, and since the launch in 2016, Apple has accounted for 85 percent of the sales, according to data from the NPD Group. \nGN said it was in second place but had only a single figure market share. But the market is still evolving and competition is fierce. \n“If we can maintain a second place in 2018, I believe we will have done very well,” Svendsen-Tune said. \nGN’s audio division accounts for 40 percent of the company’s revenue, while the hearing aid division contributes 60 percent. \n($1 = 6.1815 Danish crowns)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-08T03:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-08T03:30:07.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The comments prompted fears that one or the other of the impulsive leaders could press their buttons, making this week's rapprochement even more extraordinary.\nAlison Evans, deputy head of Asia-Pacific Country Risk, IHS Markit told CNBC Tuesday that the talks were a \"positive change\" but not foolproof.\n\"It's easy to be cynical about these talks and think that North Korea is perhaps trying to get something out of South Korea that it wants, but nonetheless there are reasons to be enthusiastic about these talks, they are the first ministerial talks since December 2015 and indeed daily contact between the South and North Korea governments and military has been cut since February 2016 … So I still think this is a positive change,\" Evans said.\nshow chapters North Korea likely to conduct further missile tests this year: Expert 13 Hours Ago | 02:18 \"(However) I think there are reasons to still be on high alert,\" she said. \"North Korea is open to talks and wants to improve relations with South Korea but I still think that North Korea is committed to developing its nuclear weapons and its ballistic missiles and in that vein, we're still likely to see more tests later this year.\"\nMore missiles, more problems North Korea has largely been seen as a rogue state by the international community for its pursuit of a nuclear program and has been on the receiving end of international condemnation and sanctions.\nIt has attracted disapproval from most quarters (although China remains an ostensible ally) for its continued nuclear tests and missile launches, the international concern being that it could attach a nuclear warhead to a missile.\nIn September 2017, North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test since 2006. In all, Pyongyang has tested a total of 23 missiles since Trump took office, and 15 of those tests involved nuclear-capable ballistic missiles. The November 2017 launch of which appeared to be an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, flew further than any of Kim Jong Un's previous tests.

The launches have ratcheted up tensions between the state and the U.S., with Trump warning North Korea after the November missile launch not to make a \"fatal miscalculation.\"\nAlthough North Korea has been given some priority by Trump, the U.S. has said it will only consider negotiations to end the nuclear weapons crisis if the state ceases to fire ballistic missiles, something that North Korea appears unlikely to give up.\nIan Bremmer, head of Eurasia Group, said on Monday that the latest talks were a positive sign, as well as North Korea's attendance at the Winter Olympics, but added that the state was likely to return to its missile testing.\n\"The North Koreans see their only effective defense against a more antagonistic and unpredictable United States as strengthening their proven deterrent capability against the American homeland. That means perfecting ICBM launch and reentry capabilities; which likely includes a (considerably more provocative) full horizontal test into the Pacific Ocean,\" Bremmer said in a note Monday.\n\"President Trump and, most recently, UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, say they'll accept no negotiations absent a willingness on the part of North Korea to cease tests (and potentially commit to denuclearization); North Korea sees significant expansion of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs as a precondition to any negotiation.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-09T10:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-09T11:13:39.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Same as always: [a] stock shortage — it's really been acute in the industrials — 401(k) money being thrown at the market, animal spirits, a stronger consumer, tax reform, deregulation and a general revaluation higher,\" the \" Mad Money \" host said. \"Who's doing the leading? Once again, it's Boeing , it's Caterpillar , it's Adobe , it's Alphabet , it's Apple , and it's Netflix .\"\nCertainly, the layout can change. On Friday, shares of frequent market leader Facebook were taken down after CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wanted to change its News Feed to promote \"meaningful social interactions.\"\nBut Facebook's 4 percent decline failed to jolt the broader market. Instead, a strong earnings report from J.P. Morgan propelled its stock and the market to new highs , erasing worries that one-time charges would make the numbers look worse than expected.\n\"J.P. Morgan's a terrific place to actually start the discussion for next week's game plan because it did set a benchmark that other banks, which all report next week, I think are going to find hard to beat,\" Cramer said.\nWith that in mind, the \"Mad Money\" host turned to the stocks and events he'll be watching next week:\nTuesday: Citigroup, UnitedHealth, CSX Citigroup : Citigroup's chief financial officer said in December that the bank could take a $20 billion hit because of the newly passed tax law , which could weigh on its Tuesday morning earnings report.\n\"I believe its buyback has been so aggressive that the company will actually still end up showing some excellent earnings growth, even as it's clear from J.P. Morgan's numbers that fixed income trading — a big revenue generator for both J.P. Morgan and Citi — was much worse than even thought,\" Cramer said. \"Citi will be hard-pressed to top J.P. Morgan, but it's no slouch.\"\nUnitedHealth : Cramer expected \"still one more blowout quarter\" from the massive health insurer, packed with insight from its rapidly growing data-driven business.\nCSX : Railroad operator CSX will report its earnings after the bell. Shares of the transport play have recovered bountifully since its late CEO Hunter Harrison passed away in December, but Cramer wasn't sold on the stock.\n\"If the rails have a weak link, it will be CSX because it has run so much,\" he said.\nWednesday: Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, ASML Holdings Bank of America : Bank of America may not have J.P. Morgan's global \"tentacles,\" but with the largest deposit base in the United States, it's the top beneficiary of rising interest rates , Cramer said ahead of its Wednesday earnings report.\nGoldman Sachs : Cramer was hopeful that Goldman would find a way to deliver a positive earnings report despite lower than expected trading volumes in the fourth quarter.\n\"It's a much more trading-oriented investment bank, and lately, the markets have lacked the kind of volatility that translates into terrific profits,\" he said. \"I'm more concerned here, though, that [CEO] Lloyd Blankfein , who's steered the bank through the hardest of times, may decide to hang up his spurs and devote the rest of his life to charity, which would be par for this incredibly good man's course. I say, not yet, please.\"\nASML : Cramer wanted this oft-overlooked semiconductor equipment maker's earnings report to give investors more details on whether there's too much new semiconductor capacity on the market.\n\"If we hear that orders are through the roof from this equipment maker or that anyone's canceling them because they've been through the roof, I could see the commodity chipmakers like Micron disappointing with some weak stock action,\" he said.\nThursday: Morgan Stanley, PPG Industries, IBM Morgan Stanley : Cramer didn't envy Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman for having to report earnings after the rest of the big banks set the bar.\n\"I think [the results will] be excellent. But by this point, will anybody really care?\" Cramer wondered. \"Aren't we more likely to see a wave of profit-taking once all the big banks have reported? You know what, that's actually a reasonable bet. Let's keep our eyes open.\"\nPPG : Industrial coatings maker PPG will report earnings before Thursday's bell, and Cramer expected a good report.\n\"I also think [PPG] could be on the verge of a value-enhancing merger,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"If I owned it, I would certainly stay long. If it gets weak earlier this week, I would buy it.\"\nIBM : Cramer advised investors to listen to IBM's conference call, led by CFO Martin Schroeter, before reacting to the computer giant's after-the-bell earnings report.\n\"[The headline numbers] can often be hard to understand until Schroeter explains them,\" he said. \"[IBM] just started a new mainframe cycle and that, historically, has been good news for the company. Plus, Warren Buffett seems to have stopped selling shares, thank heavens, and that's good news for the stock.\"\nFriday: Schlumberger Oilfield service company Schlumberger will report earnings on Friday coupled with one of Cramer's favorite conference calls in the industry.\nSince Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard called oil's bottom last quarter, the price of crude has rocketed to multi-year highs , so Cramer was eager to hear his insights.\nFinal thoughts \"Here's the bottom line: you have to respect the fact that we're in a once-in-a-lifetime move where even when a mega-cap stock like Facebook gets slammed, it has no pin action whatsoever on the rest of the market,\" Cramer said. \"You know what we've got here, don't you? We've got a beast. Still, on Tuesday, the beast is going to come in real hungry after a couple days off. I bet it gets fed once again.\"\nWATCH: Cramer's finance-filled game plan show chapters Cramer's game plan: JP Morgan set the benchmark.

But at this juncture, $10,000 per coin is the level to watch. Here are his reasons.\n• Bitcoin hasn't risen above $15,000 since Tuesday, and this apparent loss of momentum may lead to a decline in sentiment.\n• The $10,000 mark, at which bitcoin has not traded since November, would be a psychologically important level for the cryptocurrency, which was trading a little over $13,700 per coin on Friday afternoon.\n• If bitcoin were to breach that level once again, the critical question would become whether investors would step in to buy the dip or it would lead to further liquidation.\n• Earlier this week, Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO, said cryptocurrencies would likely \"come to a bad ending.\" Bitcoin's price fluctuated wildly this week, too, as South Korea was said to consider a ban on cryptocurrency trading.\nBottom line: Bitcoin's price has fallen considerably since its highs late last year and could see further pain from a fundamental and technical standpoint, according to a foreign exchange strategist.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

They also said the possibility exists of terrorists using these drones in urban areas against civilians. \n\"We're likely to see more attacks of larger scale going forward, potentially even larger than this and in a variety of things — air, land and sea,\" said Paul Scharre, director of the Technology and National Security program at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank. \nEarlier this month, militants in Syria launched a drone attack using more than a dozen weaponized unmanned aerial vehicles in Russia's Hmeymim airbase as well as a navy supply base in Tartus. Most of the drones were used on the attack against Hmeymim, located in western Syria near the city of Latakia. \nThe Russian defense ministry claims its air defenses detected 13 \"small-size air targets\" approaching its bases and repelled the attack, shooting down seven drones with its anti-aircraft missile systems and taking control of six others using electronic warfare. Vadim Savitsky | TASS | Getty Images Showing parts of drones that were used to attack a Russian military base in Syria, during a press briefing. On January 6, 2018, Russian servicemen repelled an attack by 13 armed drones on Russia's Hmeimim air base and Tartus naval base in Syria. \n\"The incident itself, while it wasn't necessarily a spectacular attack by terrorist standards, it certainly portends a very dark future,\" said Colin Clarke, a political scientist at the RAND think tank who specializes in terrorism, insurgency and criminal networks. \n\"What it signals to me is a lot of the things that we talk about that we know are going to be problems in the future may be problems now or a lot sooner than we thought,\" Clarke said. \nThe RAND expert also said the U.S. and other nations have a lot of thinking to do about how to deal with the weaponized drone technology, because it could be used not just on the battlefield but potentially in urban areas by organized terrorist groups or other bad actors. \nOn Friday, Russia said its forces conducted an operation to \"eliminate\" the group of insurgents who attacked the Hmeymim airbase Dec. 31. \"All forces and means of the multi-level Russian military intelligence in Syria were involved,\" it said. \nRussia's defense ministry also released video of what it said was the targeted strike against the militants. The ministry also has shown images of what appear to be the captured drones and homemade drone bombs. \nAccording to Moscow, it was able to track down the militants' launch site after its experts \"decoded the data recorded on the UAVs.\" \n\"U.S. bases are targets, and Russian bases are targets,\" said Olga Olicker, senior advisor and director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington defense think tank. \nExperts say the U.S. also has the capability to shoot down multiple drones as well as electronic warfare and advanced jamming technology to target or take control of enemy UAVs. The U.S. Air Force last year purchased \"counter-unmanned aerial systems\" from an Israeli company. \n\"The key is not just finding a way to target these drones,\" said Scharre. \"It's finding a way to do it in a cost-effective way. If you shoot down a $1,000 drone with a $1 million missile, you're losing every time you're doing it.\" \nThe coordinated drone attack follows a mortar shelling attack on New Year's Eve that reportedly killed two Russian service members at the Hmeymim airbase. The Russian daily Kommersant reported at least seven aircraft were destroyed , including fighter jets and a transport aircraft, but Russia's state-run Tass news agency denied aircraft were destroyed. \nAlso, it comes less than a month after Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the Hmeymim base and boasted about Russia's \"successful intervention\" against Islamic State terrorists in Syria's conflict. \nIslamic State militants previously used weaponized drones and showed video of its bomb-dropping UAVs. The terrorist group has attacked U.S.-backed forces fighting ISIS with drones and used them for surveillance purposes. ISIS also used booby-trapped drones to kill two Kurdish fighters in 2016. \n\"We have seen nonstate actors use armed drones in the past, but this is a significant step up in terms of the scale of attacks and just how many they were able to use simultaneously,\" said Scharre, who previously worked in the Pentagon and focused on unmanned and autonomous systems and emerging weapons technology. \nMeantime, Russia said it analyzed the construction of the drones and explosives of the captured crafts, concluding that the militants in Syria must have had help from a technologically advanced country. However, the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS has denied it had a role. \nAt the same time, Russia implied that the explosive material used in the bomb may have come from a Ukrainian chemical plant. \n\"Some of the Russian accusations and insinuations that have been floating around I think are meant to suggest that foreign intelligence helped provide targeting information, if not the technology,\" said Olicker. \nShe said the technology itself appears to look like \"off-the-shelf stuff\" so the claims of assistance from a technologically advanced country are \"spurious.\" She added that Moscow's \"tendency to blame other state actors\" for drone tech in the hands of militants appears disingenuous.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T03:01:15.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

At the end of 2017, the feature began enrolling users who wanted to look at their bills into the credit scoring system, Sesame Credit. \nThat allowed Sesame Credit to collect their data and share the analysis with its partners. Users could only opt out if they unchecked a button on the feature's landing page. \nSesame Credit apologized last week and cancelled the default option. \nCAC said the company should \"step up efforts to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the Alipay platform, carry out special rectifications and take effective measures to prevent similar incidents from recurring.\" \nIt quoted Alipay and Sesame Credit as saying that they had learned a \"profound lesson\" from the incident. \nAnt Financial did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The loss also marked a disappointing end to what had been such promising season for a revamped Saints team.\n\"It will sting a bit, especially as this season goes on over the next couple of weeks, feeling like it could be us, it should be us,\" quarterback Drew Brees said.\nNew Orleans lost here in Minneapolis in Week 1, but the Saints had changed so much in the 16 games since, reeling off eight consecutive wins after an 0-2 start to win the NFC South championship. They did it in large part to a strong rookie class, of which Williams was a key part.\nLed by running back Alvin Kamara and cornerback Marcus Lattimore, who are both favorites to win the NFL's offensive and defensive rookie of the year awards, respectively, the group gives the Saints reason for optimism. But the Saints face some big questions in the coming months, starting with Brees, who turns 39 on Monday and is set to become a free agent.\nWhile he has repeatedly said he wants to remain with the Saints, Brees and the team will have to figure out whether they can strike the right deal to make that happen or if the future Hall of Famer might finish his career elsewhere.\n\"I'm more towards the end of my career than I am the beginning, and I know that,\" Brees said. \"The season ends and I think this one will sting, but reflecting on the season itself and what we were able to accomplish, and some of the memories made and relationships that were built and just the way this thing came together, it really leaves me excited for the future for Saints football, especially when I think of this window over the next few years.\"\nThe Saints went through an offensive evolution this year, with the balance tilted more toward running backs Kamara and Mark Ingram. Brees threw two interceptions in the divisional round loss to the Vikings but in the second half proved why he still is among the NFL's most valuable quarterbacks, driving the Saints to what could have been the game-winning field goal in less than a minute.\nFollow Lindsay H.

They still have to protect their rights.\" And part of protecting those rights is adhering to the process.\nPerlman said the vast majority of trademark disputes are settled without the intervention of the USPTO.\nStill, it might sting the owner of the Golden Knights, Bill Foley, who told CNBC in December how proud he was of his association with the military as a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point. He also served in the U.S. Air Force, and reportedly was actively working to get the Golden Knights parachute team to perform in Las Vegas, in connection with the launch of the hockey team.\nIt might be of some comfort to the Vegas Golden Knights as they work through the process of the application for a federal trademark to know the Army's Golden Knights don't have a trademark either.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T00:30:37.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

At least for the upcoming 2019 Toyota Avalon.\nThe new Avalon, the flagship of Toyota’s portfolio, was unveiled Monday at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The new vehicle, the fifth-generation Avalon that Toyota has produced, has a bolder looking exterior and new 3.5-liter V6 or the Toyota Hybrid System II engine. Unlike other Toyota vehicles, this one was designed and manufactured in the United States.\nThe 2019 Toyota Avalon will come in four grades: the athletic and all-new XSE, the Touring, the more opulent XLE, and Limited. Hybrid versions are available in the XLE, Limited, and XSE grades. And all come standard with Apple Carplay.\nToyota made no mention of adding Android Auto however. Meaning Google won’t be part of the automaker’s ecosystem just yet--if ever.\nTwo words: Apple. CarPlay. Finally, we know… #NAIAS #Avalon pic.twitter.com/FbKDVyZHz9 \n— Toyota USA (@Toyota) January 15, 2018 \n\nGoogle's Android Auto and Apple CarPlay (AAPL, +1.15%) are two rival software platforms that integrate the smartphone with the car's infotainment system. The in-car software platform brings the functionality and feel of a smartphone--and all those apps--to the vehicle's central screen. Once users connect their smartphone into the car's USB port ( or wirelessly ), the phone's maps and navigation, music, and selected apps are integrated onto the central screen.\nA number of automakers have adopted the platforms. But Toyota, which isn’t keen on giving too much control to third-parties like Apple or Google, has resisted.\nTwo years ago, Toyota committed to using software developed by Ford Motor Co . in its cars to give drivers command and control of smartphone apps through dashboard buttons, display screens, and voice recognition tech. Ford announced in January 2016 Toyota agreed to adopt the company's SmartDeviceLink technology, an open source version of Ford AppLink. SDL is maintained by Livio, a subsidiary of Ford.\nThe companies went a step further and in 2017 formed the SmartDeviceLink (SDL) Consortium , an organization that aims to accelerate the deployment of open source software that will give consumers more options in how they connect and control their smartphone apps. Mazda Motor (MZDAY, +0.28%) , PSA Group, Fuji Heavy Industries (FUJHY, +0.48%) , and Suzuki Motor (SZKMY, +0.95%) , were the first automaker members of the consortium. Suppliers Elektrobit (EBTTF, +0.00%) , Harman (HAR, +0.00%) , Luxoft (LXFT, +0.26%) , QNX, and Xevo also joined the nonprofit organization.\nToyota announced last week during the annual tech trade show CES that Amazon’s digital assistant Alexa would be available in some Toyota and Lexus cars. Toyota customers will be able to use Alexa for more complex tasks like providing driving directions, reading news, and controlling Internet-connected home gadgets while they drive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T22:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T22:49:00.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Some critics argued the move was a publicity stunt to deflect attention from the closure of Sam's Club.\nA spokesperson from Walmart told CNBC that Walmart and Sam's Clubs, while they fall under the same parent company, are in two different parts of the business.\nWalmart, which has two million employees globally , got one of the biggest breaks under the new GOP tax plan that cut the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent.\nThe raise in wages will cost Walmart between $300 million and $400 million a year and another $400 million in one-time bonuses. The company credited the raise in wages to the tax break.\nSimon called the wage increase and bonuses \"just the tip of the iceberg\" when it comes to the money Walmart will see from tax reform.\n\"They have a lot of powder and a lot of money to invest,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, Natixis Americas chief economist, Joseph Lavorgna, appearing with Simon, called Walmart's pay raises and bonuses good news for the company's workers. But he argued the recent announcements about companies giving back to employees have been isolated cases.\n\"To get faster wage growth, the economy needs faster productivity growth,\" he said. \"If this tax package is to work, it will work because it galvanizes companies to spend on capital to get capital deepening, give workers the tools to actually get paid more because they're more productive.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T17:59:48.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It made a similar announcement for Haiti in November. \nTPS is a humanitarian program which allows citizens from other countries to temporarily remain in the U.S. This special designation is given to people from countries that are undergoing hardships like armed conflict or recovery from natural disasters. \nWhen reached for comment, the White House said in a statement that the president \"will only accept an immigration deal that adequately addresses the visa lottery system and chain migration – two programs that hurt our economy and allow terrorists into our country.\" \nThe White House's statement did not deny that the president made those remarks. \n\"Certain Washington politicians choose to fight for foreign countries, but President Trump will always fight for the American people. The President will only accept an immigration deal that adequately addresses the visa lottery system and chain migration – two programs that hurt our economy and allow terrorists into our country. Like other nations that have merit-based immigration, President Trump is fighting for permanent solutions that make our country stronger by welcoming those who can contribute to our society, grow our economy and assimilate into our great nation. He will always reject temporary, weak and dangerous stopgap measures that threaten the lives of hardworking Americans, and undercut immigrants who seek a better life in the United States through a legal pathway.\" \nThis is breaking news.

David Becker Getty Images By Sarit Markovich January 12, 2018 \nCan Kodak, best known these days as a textbook case of failing to adjust to the Digital Age, make the ultimate comeback? \nThat’s the question raised by the company’s recent debut of KodakCoin and a digital platform for storage, authentication, and rights-management of photographs—a foray into the surging domains of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. \nOn one hand, the move seems to represent a stark contrast to the Kodak of old, which stood by and watched Fuji and other competitors capitalize on the advent of digital photos while its own revenue and share of the photography market imploded. Investors have rewarded the move by tripling Kodak’s stock price . On the other, critics have argued that Kodak’s new strategy, while attention-grabbing, creates little real value. In reality, it’s too early to tell. \nKodak’s strategy could create value—but it depends on how well the iconic business deploys the new products and services, and the reactions of their target market and competitors. \nLet’s consider these dynamics for the related offerings in question: one platform for photo storage and rights management, along with payment/transaction management; and the initial coin offering (ICO) for KodakCoin. Rights-management platform \nKodak (KODK) wants to attract photographers with a platform that will not only house their pictures, but protect them from unauthorized use. The company is even touting technology that will search proactively for infringement through “ continual web-crawling ” and alert users. There is large potential value here, as this solves mounting rights-related problems for photographers. \nThe caveat: The Kodak technology has to work as promised. Will it be superior to current means of rights protection, such as digital watermarks? How well will the technology crawl the web to spot rights-infringement? This requires strong image-processing technology to identify identical or similar images. If done well, it will likely become a go-to platform for photographers, creating value for all parties. Platform-based transactions \nBeyond protecting the rights to pictures, Kodak wants to enable photographers—small sellers—to transact with customers on the same platform that houses their images, rather than through outside payment processors such as Paypal (PYPL) or Venmo. In theory, that would afford users greater convenience—one-stop transactions—while providing Kodak valuable control over more user activities, along with a trove of usable data. \nFor example, the business could study transactions to identify more popular, higher-volume photographers or field of photography and target them with specific products (cameras and lenses), services, and offers. But again, Kodak has to offer something superior than what’s already out there. In this case, that means free (like Venmo), protected (like Paypal), convenient (like Paypal and Venmo) transactions for users. That’s challenging to do profitably —will Kodak pick up fees to credit-card-based funds onto the platform, for example? Will Kodak be liable for transferred funds that were not rewarded with a satisfying product? \nKodakCoin \nWith the end-of-January ICO of KodakCoin , the business is entering the cryptocurrency domain, a market all over the headlines, but already dominated by Bitcoin and others. Why is Kodak making this move? One argument is that it’s a cheap way to access capital—something Kodak may not be able to do easily from traditional investors these days. Beyond generating cash, the strategy can provide incentive for buyers of the new currency to be the early adopters of the Kodak platform: The more users of the platform (photographers and customers), the more KodakCoin users there are, and thus the greater the value of both. \nBut new online platforms—and cryptocurrencies, for that matter—always face a Catch-22: They can’t grow without users, and it’s hard to get lots of users without a critical mass of them in the first place. The ICO could act to motivate those who’ve already invested in the platform to act as ambassadors of the Kodak brand, and thus of KodakCoin. But Kodak is likely betting that (1) any success with the cryptocurrency won’t be based on a mounting “Bitcoin bubble,” resulting in devaluation of the coin, and thus large, near-term losses for Kodak and the investors, and (2) players like Fuji won’t enter the market with a better platform or currency offerings. That may be a substantial bet, whatever the currency it’s made with. \nAs suggested earlier, despite all the prognostication about Kodak’s new crypto strategy, it’s hard to say exactly what will happen. But analysis of the new offerings and their context suggests that Kodak could drive value with them. The business just has to remember that “first announcer” of a new platform doesn’t necessarily get first-mover advantages and network effects. Those usually go to an early player with the highest-quality offerings. \nSarit Markovich is clinical associate professor of strategy at The Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.

He was the creator of the critically acclaimed CBS sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond which aired for 9 seasons and won more than 70 Emmys.\nRosenthal's new show Somebody Feed Phil, available on Netflix, said the idea came from Ray Romano's real-life lack of interest in travel.\n\"It started on Raymond, it started when we went to Italy with the show,\" Rosenthal told CNBC's On the Money in an interview.\n\"Ray had never been to Europe ,\" he added.\nNot only that, but Rosenthal said Romano didn't really want to go. However, Romano's perspective changed after filming the episode in Italy.\n\"That's when the light bulb went off, because I got such a high seeing it happen to him, I thought what if I can do this for other people?\"\nSomebody Feed Phil showcases 6 cities: Bangkok, Tel Aviv, Lisbon, Mexico City, Saigon, and New Orleans where he eats an assortment of food from high-end restaurants to street vendors.\nOne of the chefs featured is Jay Fai, a street vendor in Bangkok, who prepared a crab omelet that Rosenthal deemed \"one of the best things you'll ever eat.\"\nAnd he's not alone in his opinion. After filming the episode, Fai earned a Michelin star , the first ever in Bangkok. \nSo how does Rosenthal pick which cities to feature?\nHe said he wants to start with \"Earth's greatest hits, the best, most accessible places to go.\"\nBangkok may not seem like an obvious choice to many, but Rosenthal disagreed.\n\"Everyone speaks English, it's a big modern city, all the conveniences, you're going to have a hotel, you're going to have a bed…the food is unbelievable,\" Rosenthal explained.\nIn his New Orleans episode, Rosenthal says you'll see beignets, jambalaya, as well as a few unexpected surprises such as an Israeli restaurant called Shaya, as well as a \"veggie reuben\" made with collard greens instead of meat.\nThis isn't Rosenthal's first travel show. I'll Have What Phil's Having was produced by PBS and ran in 2015. But according to the Hollywood Reporter, the show was too expensive to make . \nNetflix , which is spending billions on original content , picked up the show under a new title.\nOn working with Netflix, Rosenthal said the company gives him a lot of creative freedom.\nHe added, \"You don't worry about competition because it's like you go into a store, and everything's there on the shelf for you.

That accounted for nearly a third of the total U.S. export volume and was valued at $1.37 billion, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation.

It's something only Apple has been able to perfect.\nTake LG and Samsung, for example. Both companies announced products I don't think I'll see in my house within the next 10 years. LG has a fridge with Amazon's Alexa voice assistant built in, for example -- something that was technically introduced last year. Samsung is also putting its Bixby voice assistant -- already in its smartphones -- into its appliances.\nShort of Wayne Szalinski from the movie Honey I Shrunk the Kids, I can't think of anyone who actually needs this. Why not just pull out a smartphone to ask the weather, or turn to your Amazon Echo to add an item to your shopping list?\nIf there was a theme this year, it's that gadget-makers are putting tech where I don't think we need it — just because they can. There were pole dancing robots. Robots that helped you play ping pong, that probably won't ever sell on the market to general consumers.\nThere are other examples, too, like TVs that are larger than most walls we could ever put them on (and which may never actually come to market at affordable prices for many, many years), glasses that still look just as silly as Google Glass (and have yet to prove they'll be useful by actual consumers), and too many concepts and Kickstarter projects to count.\nSadly, there were few products one might actually be able to buy, even if you wanted to. What was once a show with dozens of new TVs and laptops and smartphones that were going to hit the market in weeks or months, is now a show about ideas.\nIt's not bad, it's just curious we still call it a \"consumer\" electronics show.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T19:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T19:25:09.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Kim Jong Un’s hackers are stealing digital cash. Nicolas Maduro hopes a cryptocurrency backed by oil will lure investment back to Venezuela. \nAll three leaders are wading into the crypto-craze as their regimes grapple with the same problem: Sanctions curbing their access to the global financial system. But while bitcoin and opaque virtual currencies can provide sources of cash for political pariahs, the market’s still too nascent to make a meaningful skirting of a U.S.-led economic blockade possible. \nAny autocrat eyeing bitcoin as a sanctions safe haven must confront a simple matter of scale. All the world’s digital tokens are worth about $700 billion, according to Coinmarketcap.com. That’s about one-seventh of the daily foreign exchange market. \n“Think about how many U.S. dollars are in circulation and how much each bitcoin would have to be worth to match that value — it would be a ludicrously big number,” said Tom Uren, a visiting fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s International Cyber Policy Centre. “In the long term, that’s possible, but we are talking decades and decades. Cash isn’t going away any time soon.” Curbing the market \nMoreover, regulators are quickly moving to rein in digital currencies. China’s central bank declared initial coin offerings illegal in September. And on Thursday, South Korea’s justice minister reiterated a proposal to ban cryptocurrency exchanges altogether. Yonhap New Agency reported Saturday that authorities asked banks to adopt real-name digital currency accounts. \nFor more on Bitcoin, watch Fortune’s video: \nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., on Friday he was “not at all” worried that Russia or others countries could use digital tokens to evade sanctions. “I don’t think that’s a concern,” Mnuchin said, noting that digital coin exchanges were subject to the same requirements as banks to scrutinize who their customers are. \nThe U.S. sanctions people and organizations, not assets, and those measures still apply to states that park their earnings in cryptocurrencies. Even if Maduro can overcome investor skepticism and attract support to Venezuela’s oil-backed “petro,” those who use the token could find themselves ensnared by sanctions. \n“The detail of how you issue it is critical because you have to trust the currency and there has to be a market for it,” said Jim Fitzsimmons, a director at Control Risks in Singapore. “Venezuela is having a really bad time. I just don’t see how the gee-wizzery cryptocurrency stuff is going to help.” \nIn Russia, the central bank opposes a finance ministry effort — announced Thursday — to allow cryptocurrency trading on official exchanges. Undeterred, Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseev told reporters the ministry would use the “power of thoughts and words” to convince the central bank. \nUsing digital currencies to evade sanctions would be particularly problematic for petro-states that need access to the mainstream financial system — especially U.S. dollars — to sell their oil. Iran’s economy, for instance, is too big for bitcoin to serve as savior. \nStill, cryptocurrencies do open new avenues for isolated regimes and their political elite to smuggle cash across borders, especially for smaller, impoverished states like North Korea. North Korean hackers seized a South Korean server last summer and used it to mine digital coins worth about $25,000, according to Kwak Kyoung-ju, who leads a hacking analysis team at the South Korean government-backed Financial Security Institute. \nSouth Korean investigators are also probing if North Korean cyber thieves were responsible for the December collapse of a Seoul-based cryptocurrency exchange, which lost 17% of its assets. \n“These things are an incredible asset for criminals and governments who want to do illicit things because they are decentralized, they are not regulated, and there is a lot of anonymity,” said Tim Wellsmore, Canberra-based Asia-Pacific director of threat intelligence at FireEye Inc., a cyber security company. They are total freedom, “open slather,” he said. \nDigital currencies offer states a covert way to fund other sorts of mischief, such as financing armed rebel groups or bribing politicians, said ASPI’s Uren. But something like a cyber-attack on a country’s electric grid may be cheaper and more disruptive. \nOn Friday, Mnuchin said he was mostly concerned about bitcoin’s potential to be used in crimes, such as money laundering. He said he was working with U.S. and foreign regulators to closely monitor its use. \n“We want to make sure that bad people cannot use these currencies to do bad things,” he said.

The target represents a 23 percent gain from Friday's close of $1,305.20.\n\"We believe the emergence of Amazon's advertising business can support both margin and multiple expansion and could be a greater catalyst for the shares if management shares more data points like it did for Amazon Web Services,\" BMO analyst Daniel Salmon wrote on Monday. \"The end result is greater confidence in the company's advertising opportunity and an increase in our estimates.\"\nThe analyst's new price target implies a market cap of $771 billion given the current level of common stock. Shares rose about 2 percent on Tuesday.\n\nAmazon's ascent in the retail world has been nearly 21 years in the making, but the e-commerce giant has been accruing market cap at a faster rate in recent years.\nFive years ago, shares of Amazon traded at $272, climbing to $809 per share by January 2016. With its shares now trading around $1,325, the company is ranked fourth in the S&P 500 in terms of market cap, behind Apple , Alphabet and Microsoft .\nSalmon noted that the company's sponsored product ads, headline search ads and product display ads present the company with an $18 billion revenue opportunity in the medium term. Amazon may also see a bump in revenue when it starts recording certain advertising fees as revenue, the analyst added.\nAmazon has been dabbling in various advertising products across its portfolio in recent months, preparing for a larger move into the space this year. Conversations appeared to be focused on the company's search and video products, sources told CNBC. One source said Amazon is working with third-party mobile advertising firms like Kargo.\nKen Sena of Wells Fargo is now the second most bullish analyst on Wall Street on the stock with a $1,525 12-month target, according to FactSet. Three others have $1,500 price targets.\nWhile the company's stock rose 60 percent in the past 12 months, nearly 12 percent of that gain has occurred in the new year alone. But despite the dramatic rise, Wall Street has remained largely positive on shares. Echoing Salmon's sentiment, Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson reiterated his buy rating last week. \n\"Amazon, despite its size and continued strong growth, is arguably still in the early innings of its share gain potential, even in the company's most penetrated market,\" Olson wrote on Jan. 9.\nOlson increased his price target for Amazon shares to $1,400 from $1,200 last week.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T15:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T15:55:53.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It's been the go-to response to him from Democrats and even several Republicans who have thought this is a foolproof weapon against him since he first announced his candidacy for president in 2015.\nHow's that working out for them?\nThe fact is the charge of racism doesn't work very well on Trump. But folks keep trying it anyway.\nIt still seems to be the strategy right now in the battle over the budget and the special DACA protections for the children of illegal immigrants. That's how it's playing out after Illinois Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin accused Trump of making the now-infamous \"s---hole\" comment about Haiti and African countries last week. Frantic depictions of those comments as definitive proof of Trump's racism have dominated the news cycle ever since.\nThe goal now seems to be to use this racism-branding tactic in order to shame Trump into bending to the Democrats' will. On Monday, Durbin revealed he's pursuing that shaming strategy, telling the Chicago Sun-Times that, \"if President Trump is not a racist, he can prove it\" by making a deal on the DACA legislation.\nGood luck with that.\nThe reason the shaming strategy is a long shot this time and has failed in the past is because it's nearly impossible to shame or even scare Trump at all. It's even harder to shame him into doing anything.\nLook at the president's tweets and public statements every time he is criticized. Does he ever sound or act like a guy who even considers contrition? Donald Trump is a man who almost never chooses to stay above the fray no matter who is attacking him and how they do it. This was his well-documented behavior before he was a candidate, when he was a candidate, and even as president.\nThe shaming game has its own special hall of shame when it comes to its ineffectiveness. The highlights are:\nIt not only failed to get then-candidate Trump to stop talking about Mexican illegal immigration after his first speech as a candidate, the issue became the hallmark of his campaign. Calling Trump anti-Muslim because of his immigration ban on several predominantly Muslim countries produced only the slightest tweaks to the policy and no real backing down. Legal challenges to the ban have only enraged and hardened Trump's resolve even more as they continue to be upheld by the Supreme Court. Even when racism isn't a factor, shaming Trump doesn't work. The many critics of the GOP tax reform bill found that out the hard way when he continued to push for the bill and eventually got it across the finish line. That was despite the constant depiction of the bill by its opponents as a shameful boon to the rich. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers even said 10,000 people will die per year in America because of the tax bill. That didn't deter the president at all. So, predictably, Trump is responding the opposite way to this latest shaming attempt. He's now toggling back and forth between taking a harder line on immigration policy and insisting he's no racist in his public comments and tweets.\nTrump tweet\nTrump tweet 2\nThat's a far cry from Trump's statement before the \"s---hole\" controversy when he said he'd sign any DACA compromise bipartisan congressional leaders came up with.\nIf the Democrats really are concerned about protecting the so-called \"Dreamer\" immigrants, there's really no excuse for them to be surprised by what's occurred over the last few days. Now, the chances are much greater that the Democrats will have to move to shut down the government when the budget deadline passes on Friday. Worse for them, their bargaining position on behalf of the DACA recipients is weakened now that the focus on the vulgar comments in a closed door meeting has flipped the president from compliant to defiant.\nGovernment shutdowns are a tricky matter. Politicians usually run for the hills at the mere chance that they may be blamed for a shutdown. That's a good thing for people who like government compromise because shutdowns are always the result of a failed budget vote and it takes a 60 votes in the Senate to pass a budget.\nWith that in mind, congressional Republicans began placing a bet that the Democrats wouldn't want to be seen as causing a shutdown over the DACA issue last year. They were right to the point that the Democrats did agree to push off the matter for a month with a temporary spending bill.\nBut now, the Democrats are close to proudly promising to shut the government down over this issue. Yes, polls frequently show clear majorities of Americans support allowing \"Dreamers\" to stay in the U.S. provided they meet certain requirements. But there are also polls that show just as many voters support tougher immigration laws. And most damning of all for Democrats, the overall immigration issue actually remains a relatively low priority for most voters. A Morning Consult/Politico poll released just two months ago showed that only 29 percent of respondents thought extending the DACA protections should be a priority for Congress.\nBut based on the uproar over Trump's comments alone, the Democrats are willing to play with government shutdown fire.\nSo America's political scene is dominated by two enduring spectacles at the moment. First, we have a president who says politically incorrect and vulgar things with regularity and has no shame or remorse about it. Second, we have the Democratic Party and most of Trump's opponents clinging to and doubling down on a demonstrably failed strategy.\nIt's not clear who \"wins\" in this remarkable exchange. But we do know that the losers are millions of Americans who rely on a functioning government, clear immigration status, and politicians with some grip on reality.\nCommentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist.

Millennials in particular took on much more credit card debt, climbing 10.8 percent from $3,894 to $4,315. Meanwhile, Gen Xers saw an increase of 5.1 percent in credit card debt from $7,372 to $7,750.\nEarlier this week, the Federal Reserve announced that outstanding credit card debt hit a new high in November, increasing by $11.2 billion to $1.023 trillion.\nExperian's wide-ranging report also highlights that non-mortgage debt (which includes auto and student loan debt) is really rising, especially for younger people, and is up 15 percent for Gen Z, 9 percent for millennials and 5 percent for Gen Xers.\nExperian's analysis is based on a statistically relevant sampling of Experian's consumer credit database as of Q2 2017.\nHow to boost your score A recent study from LendEDU found that 25 percent of millennials can't even identify what a credit score is.\nYour credit score is important because it gives potential lenders a good snapshot of your overall financial health. A low score could impact the interest rate you get on major purchases like a home or car. Most credit scores range from 300 to 850, and a good score is typically 700 or above .\nYou can boost your score by decreasing your credit utilization ratio, which can be done by keeping your balances low. Just because that credit is available to you doesn't mean you should max it out every month. Instead, aim to use under 30 percent of your available credit.\nPaying of your balance in full, on time, every time can also help increase your score, as can limiting your applications for new credit.\nLike this story?

This is Sy. \nTennis legend Serena Williams is widely regarded as one of the greatest athletes on the planet, and perhaps ever. She recently achieved another stunning milestone—saving her own life after giving birth, according to a fascinating profile in Vogue . And Williams’ harrowing experience serves as a high-profile microcosm of the racial inequities which still haunt the American medical system. \nVogue outlines how Williams, who suffers from blood clots and must take anti-clotting medication because of it, knew that something had gone terribly wrong just a day after giving birth to her child: \nThe next day, while recovering in the hospital, Serena suddenly felt short of breath. Because of her history of blood clots, and because she was off her daily anticoagulant regimen due to the recent surgery, she immediately assumed she was having another pulmonary embolism. (Serena lives in fear of blood clots.) She walked out of the hospital room so her mother wouldn’t worry and told the nearest nurse, between gasps, that she needed a CT scan with contrast and IV heparin (a blood thinner) right away. The nurse thought her pain medicine might be making her confused. But Serena insisted, and soon enough a doctor was performing an ultrasound of her legs. “I was like, a Doppler? I told you, I need a CT scan and a heparin drip,” she remembers telling the team. The ultrasound revealed nothing, so they sent her for the CT, and sure enough, several small blood clots had settled in her lungs. Minutes later she was on the drip. “I was like, listen to Dr. Williams!” \nSuch a scrape with death makes for a sensational story when it features an icon; but it’s also the story of millions of women of color across the nation, as ProPublica explores in a searing investigative series on the effect socioeconomics has on motherhood in America . \nOne piece in that series, titled “How Hospitals Are Failing Black Mothers,” carries special poignance given Williams’ ordeal. “It’s been long-established that black women… fare worse in pregnancy and childbirth, dying at a rate more than triple that of white mothers. And while part of the disparity can be attributed to factors like poverty and inadequate access to health care, there is growing evidence that points to the quality of care at hospitals where a disproportionate number of black women deliver, which are often in neighborhoods disadvantaged by segregation,” writes Annie Waldman. \nIndeed, the public data highlights that when it comes to death and disease , from cancer to blood disorders to postpartum complications, the American medical system has a stubborn and long-standing racial gap. \nRead on for the day’s news, and enjoy your weekend. We’ll be back on Tuesday following the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Sy Mukherjee @the_sy_guy DIGITAL HEALTH \nTelemedicine may actually help you lose weight. A new study suggests telemedicine can help people keep track with their weight loss goals, according to MobiHealthNews. “Our findings suggest that health coaching using a telemedicine-based weight loss program may be effective at reducing clinically significant body weight (more than 5 percent) in obese adults,” wrote the study authors. “The current weight loss program combines three key elements shown to improve weight loss outcomes: a low-calorie diet with a preference for low glycemic carbohydrates, physical activity monitoring, and support for behavior change through a multi-disciplinary approach to treatment.” ( MobiHealthNews ) INDICATIONS \nAstraZeneca scores an expansion for its “PARP” cancer drug. British drug giant AstraZeneca has won Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its cancer drug Lynparza to treat certain types of metastatic breast cancer . It’s a particularly significant label expansion for the drug because it’s part of a new class of treatments called “PARP inhibitors”—and, until now, these kinds of drugs had only been approved for ovarian cancers, suggesting there’s a far bigger market for the treatment type. THE BIG PICTURE \nA presidential checkup. President Donald Trump will be getting a physical exam today, his first medical checkup since assuming the presidency. That’s fairly par for the course, but there’s bound to be some added drama to this presidential physical given the renewed chatter about Trump’s mental fitness (a conversation that some mental health experts have called essential while others have slammed it as unethical and counterproductive to democracy). Back in 2016, I explored the issue at more length, including the “Goldwater rule” adopted by psychiatrists.

Not so for brainless robots – in fact, calculating robotic movement is its own scientific subfield.\nMy colleagues here at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design have figured out how to apply an algorithm originally designed to help robots move to an entirely different problem: drug discovery. The algorithm has helped unlock a class of molecules known as peptide macrocycles, which have appealing pharmaceutical properties.\nOne small step, one giant leap Roboticists who program movement conceive of it in what they call \"degrees of freedom.\" Take a metal arm, for instance. The elbow, wrist and knuckles are movable and thus contain degrees of freedom. The forearm, upper arm and individual sections of each finger do not. If you want to program an android to reach out and grasp an object or take a calculated step, you need to know what its degrees of freedom are and how to manipulate them.\nThe more degrees of freedom a limb has, the more complex its potential motions. The math required to direct even simple robotic limbs is surprisingly abstruse ; Ferdinand Freudenstein, a father of the field, once called the calculations underlying the movement of a limb with seven joints \" the Mount Everest of kinematics .\"\nshow chapters Check out this robotic hand with a human touch      3:18 PM ET Wed, 4 Jan 2017 | 00:47 Freudenstein developed his kinematics equations at the dawn of the computer era in the 1950s. Since then, roboticists have increasingly relied on algorithms to solve these complex kinematic puzzles. One algorithm in particular — known as \"generalized kinematic closure\" — bested the seven-joint problem, allowing roboticists to program fine control into mechanical hands.\nMolecular biologists took notice.\nMany molecules inside living cells can be conceived of as chains with pivot points, or degrees of freedom, akin to tiny robotic arms. These molecules flex and twist according to the laws of chemistry. Peptides and their elongated cousins, proteins, often must adopt precise three-dimensional shapes in order to function. Accurately predicting the complex shapes of peptides and proteins allows scientists like me to understand how they work.\nMastering macrocycles While most peptides form straight chains, a subset, known as macrocycles, form rings. This shape offers distinct pharmacological advantages . Ringed structures are less flexible than floppy chains, making macrocycles extremely stable. And because they lack free ends, some can resist rapid degradation in the body — an otherwise common fate for ingested peptides.\n\nMacrocycles have a circular 'main chain' (shown as thick lines) and many 'side chains' (shown as thin lines). The macrocycle on the left — cyclosporin — evolved in a fungus. The one on the right was designed on a computer. Source: Ian Haydon/Institute for Protein Design \n\nNatural macrocycles such as cyclosporin are among the most potent therapeutics identified to date. They combine the stability benefits of small-molecule drugs, like aspirin, and the specificity of large antibody therapeutics, like herceptin. Experts in the pharmaceutical industry regard this category of medicinal compounds as \"attractive, albeit underappreciated.\"\nMore from The Conversation:\nUS life expectancy just dropped for the second year in a row \nNew study reveals why some people are more creative than others \nWhat gig economy workers can learn from the success of romance writers \n\"There is a huge diversity of macrocycles in nature — in bacteria, plants, some mammals,\" said Gaurav Bhardwaj, a lead author of the new report in Science, \"and nature has evolved them for their own particular functions.\" Indeed, many natural macrocycles are toxins. Cyclosporin, for instance, displays antifungal activity yet also acts as a powerful immunosuppressant in the clinic, making it useful as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis or to prevent rejection of transplanted organs.\nA popular strategy for producing new macrocycle drugs involves grafting medicinally useful features onto otherwise safe and stable natural macrocycle backbones. \"When it works, it works really well, but there's a limited number of well-characterized structures that we can confidently use,\" said Bhardwaj. In other words, drug designers have only had access to a handful of starting points when making new macrocycle medications.\nTo create additional reliable starting points, his team used generalized kinematic closure — the robot joint algorithm — to explore the possible conformations, or shapes, that macrocycles can adopt.\nAdaptable algorithms As with keys, the exact shape of a macrocycle matters. Build one with the right conformation and you may unlock a new cure.\nModeling realistic conformations is \"one of the hardest parts\" of macrocycle design, according to Vikram Mulligan, another lead author of the report. But thanks to the efficiency of the robotics-inspired algorithm, the team was able to achieve \"near-exhaustive sampling\" of plausible conformations at \"relatively low computational cost.\"\nThe calculations were so efficient, in fact, that most of the work did not require a supercomputer, as is usually the case in the field of molecular engineering. Instead, thousands of smartphones belonging to volunteers were networked together to form a distributed computing grid, and the scientific calculations were doled out in manageable chunks.\nWith the initial smartphone number-crunching complete, the team pored over the results — a collection of hundreds of never-before-seen macrocycles. When a dozen such compounds were chemically synthesized in the lab, nine were shown to actually adopt the predicted conformation. In other words, the smartphones were accurately rendering molecules that scientists can now optimize for their potential as targeted drugs.\nThe team estimates the number of macrocycles that can confidently be used as starting points for drug design has jumped from fewer than 10 to over 200, thanks to this work. Many of the newly designed macrocycles contain chemical features that have never been seen in biology.\nTo date, macrocyclic peptide drugs have shown promise in battling cancer, cardiovascular disease, inflammation and infection. Thanks to the mathematics of robotics, a few smartphones and some cross-disciplinary thinking, patients may soon see even more benefits from this promising class of molecules.\nCommentary by Ian Haydon, a doctoral student in biochemistry at the University of Washington.

Nicholas Kamm—AFP/Getty Images By The Associated Press 9:37 PM EST \nPresident Donald Trump defended himself Sunday in the wake of recent disparaging comments about Haiti and African nations, declaring that “I am not a racist.” \nTrump addressed the issue briefly as he arrived for dinner at his private golf club with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California. \nAsked what he thinks about people who think he is racist, Trump said, “No, No. I am not a racist.” He told reporters: “I am the least racist person you have ever interviewed. That I can tell you.” \nTrump also denied making the statements attributed to him, but avoided specifics about what he did or did not say. \n“Did you see what various senators in the room said about my comments?” he asked. “They weren’t made.” \nTrump stands accused of using the word “shithole” to describe African countries during an Oval Office meeting last Thursday with a bipartisan group of six senators. The president also questioned the need to admit more Haitians to the U.S., according to people who were briefed on the conversation but were not authorized to describe the meeting publicly. \nTrump also said in the meeting that he would prefer immigrants from countries like Norway instead. \nThe White House has not denied that Trump said “shithole” though Trump has already pushed back on some depictions of the meeting. \nA confidant of Trump’s told The Associated Press that the president spent Thursday evening calling friends and outside advisers to judge their reaction to his remarks. Trump wasn’t apologetic and denied he was racist, instead blaming the media for distorting his meaning, said the confidant, who wasn’t authorized to disclose a private conversation and spoke on condition of anonymity. \nSen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the only Democrat at Thursday’s meeting, said Trump had indeed said what he was reported to have said. Durbin said the remarks were “vile, hate-filled and clearly racial in their content.” He said Trump used the most vulgar term “more than once.” \nTrump commented as Durbin was presenting details of a compromise immigration plan that included providing $1.6 billion for a first installment of the president’s long-sought border wall. \nTrump took particular issue with the idea that people who’d fled to the U.S. after disasters hit their homes in places such as El Salvador, Guatemala and Haiti would be allowed to stay as part of the deal, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to publicly describe the discussion. \nWhen it came to talk of extending protections for Haitians, Durbin said Trump replied: “We don’t need more Haitians.'” \nFor more on Trump’s immigration remarks, watch Fortune’s video: \n“He said ‘Put me down for wanting more Europeans to come to this country. Why don’t we get more people from Norway?” Durbin said. \nRepublican Sens. David Perdue of Georgia and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who also attended the meeting, initially said in a statement Friday that they “do not recall the president saying these comments specifically.” \nOn Sunday, they backtracked and challenged other senators’ descriptions of the remarks. \nPerdue described as a “gross misrepresentation” reports that Trump used the vulgarity. He said Durbin and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina were mistaken in indicating that was the case. Graham also attended the meeting. \n“I am telling you that he did not use that word. And I’m telling you it’s a gross misrepresentation,” Perdue said on ABC’s “This Week.” \nCotton told CBS’“Face the Nation” that he “didn’t hear” the word used — “and I was sitting no further away from Donald Trump than Dick Durbin was.” \nTrump insisted in a tweet on Friday that he “never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said ‘take them out.’ Made up by Dems.” Trump wrote, “I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings – unfortunately, no trust!” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-15T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-15T04:37:34.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

That's only partly true. \nAt public, four-year institutions, costs for the 2017-18 school year hit $20,770, according to the College Board . Tuition plus room and board at four-year private universities was much higher: $47,000, on average, in the current academic year. \nHowever, about two-thirds of all full-time students receive aid, which can bring the sticker price significantly down. Your net price is a college's tuition and fees minus grants, scholarships and education tax benefits, according to the College Board. \nTo that end, The Princeton Review ranked colleges by how much financial aid is awarded and how satisfied students are with their packages. The report is based on data collected from fall 2016 through summer 2017. \nThe schools that fared the best were all private schools, many of which have sky-high prices, but very generous aid packages. show chapters 10:36 AM ET Fri, 31 March 2017 | 01:10 \n\"We look at sticker price but also academics and financial aid.

Played by comedian-actor Jack Black, Lewan just wants to be loved and live the American dream.\nUnfortunately, living the dream takes money, a lot more than Lewan can muster playing weddings and other small-time gigs with his polka band, as well as manning a gift shop with his wife (played by Jenny Slate) in Hazleton, Pennsylvania.\nSo, Lewan stumbles on another idea. \nWhen an elderly couple, enthralled by Lewan's upbeat and kitschy polka shows, wander into his shop, he entices them to invest in \"Jan Lewan\" enterprises. He tosses a thin pamphlet across his desk and tells his would-be investors to think it over.\nThey, of course, fall for his charms and while grumbling how they've been mistreated by stockbrokers and Wall Street, fork over their money. You can see how this will end.\nTo make sure you don't fall prey to the same type of con, consider these lessons:\nDon't mistake affability for financial savvy One of the reasons con artists like Lewan are able to raise money from unsuspecting marks is that they are just so darn nice. Lewan/Black always inquires about family, and his over-the-top enthusiasm for his dubious investment schemes are infectious.\nNever confuse this with doing your own due diligence. Check out the offering carefully. Is there a business plan? Are audited numbers of income, expenses and potential future profits available? No? Then pass. Who are the mangers of the business? Find out and Google them. They won't tell you? Then pass.\nCharm is never a substitute for actually knowing what you are doing.\nOlder investors are often prey Sad, but true. Seniors often fall for this type of con more than other age cohorts. Reporting by CNBC's Kelli Grant on elder fraud and abuse showed that this is a $36.5 billion a year issue.\nBait and switch In the story, one older couple corner Lewan in his office and demand their money back (which of course has swelled from phony returns). As he's writing out a check that he knows would be sure to bounce, he lets slip that he's starting a new fund, one with \"guaranteed\" returns of 20 percent and only open to a select few. The couple, with dollar signs flashing in their eyes, tear up the check and immediately invest even more money .\nNever fall for these high-pressure, better-get-in-now-before-it's-too-late tactics.\nUnregulated securities are, well, unregulated In the story, Lewan starts selling what's described as promissory notes, likely unsecured ones at that, meaning that they're not backed by any physical assets. Of course, he skips an essential step, registering them with regulators.\nSelling unregistered securities is a particularly ripe area for the not-so-above-board; FINRA, the brokerage industry's self-funded regulator, has called them out in investor alerts.\nGenerally, selling unregistered securities is restricted to so-called accredited investors, those who by virtue of high annual income or assets are deemed to be sufficiently knowledgable to evaluate the risk or sustain a loss. That doesn't always happen.\nWhile the authorities eventually step in and shut Lewan down, it's not before the damage is done. That should be a warning to you. Don't rely on regulators to catch these things before it's too late.\nThere is no free lunch Anytime someone promises you \"guaranteed\" returns from investments, they're engaging in some magical thinking. In fact, the smartest character in the movie is Slate's skeptical mother, who is convinced, correctly, that Lewan is up to no good.\nLater in the film, when one bilked older couple confront her in a shopping mall parking lot over her son-in-law's dishonesty, she berates them: \"You idiots, why did you think you could get 12 percent, when the bank is only paying 3 percent!\" (She then eggs their car, just to make the point).\nAnytime you're promised outsized returns, it's more likely fantasy than fact.\nBy the way, Lewan eventually conned investors out of almost $5 million, according to the show. And spent five years in prison.\nHe has vowed to pay those back he scammed — from polka shows.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T19:48:30.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The 14-member OPEC cartel has also boasted better adherence to output limits than in the past, according to analysts.\nOn Tuesday, Merrill Lynch analysts said they now expect the oil market to be undersupplied by about 430,000 barrels a day in 2018, up from their prior forecast for a 100,000-barrel-per-day deficit.\nThe bank now sees Brent averaging $64 a barrel in 2018, versus an earlier estimate for $56 a barrel. Merrill also raised its outlook for U.S. crude to $60 a barrel from $52.\nshow chapters Crude prices sit near 3-year highs 9 Hours Ago | 03:26 \"In short, inventories are coming down faster than we expected and OPEC is succeeding at rebalancing the oil market,\" wrote Francisco Blanch, head of global commodities and derivatives research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nGoldman Sachs is not ready to raise its $62 target on Brent and $57.50 forecast for U.S. crude in 2018, but says there's a growing risk that global inventories will fall too quickly and push up prices.\nU.S. drillers are likely to start pumping more oil after a sharp rally in prices since December, Goldman analysts say. But the bank believes there will be a lag in the price response, which could allow prices to keep running up.\nMeanwhile, global oil stockpiles in developed countries could actually fall below the five-year average — the level OPEC is targeting — as inventories approach normal levels, oil demand potentially outstrips Goldman's estimate and OPEC possibly cuts output too deeply.\n\"First, the lagged reporting of inventory data and OPEC's own inertia create risks that the group exits the cuts well after inventories have normalized,\" wrote a team led by Jeffrey Currie, Goldman's global head of commodities research. \"Second, we continue to believe that OPEC's 5-year average inventory target is too aggressive.\"\nOPEC, Russia and other producers have agreed to keep 1.8 million barrels a day off the market through the end of the year. Several oil ministers have said it's too early to discuss an exit strategy for the deal.\nCurrie and his colleagues also say that \"oil inventories should be adjusted for demand levels to correct for a steadily growing oil market.\"\nshow chapters Energy off to a strong start in 2018 5 Hours Ago | 01:14 Morgan Stanley equity analyst Martijn Rats said Monday that strong capital flows into the oil market will occasionally push Brent prices into the $70-$75 range. For the third quarter of 2018, he raised his price target on Brent to $75 a barrel, up from $63 a barrel.\nThe bank believes the oil market is likely to remain undersupplied in 2018, which should keep prices in backwardation. This means that current oil prices are higher than prices for crude deliveries in the future.\nBackwardation encourages traders to buy oil futures because it gives them a chance to play the so-called roll yield, said Rats. The roll yield is the profit traders can earn when they roll their investment in crude oil futures, which expire every month, into contracts that expire at a later date.\n\"If this persists for an extended period, we expect it will continue to attract inflows into the futures market. As these flows can be much larger than physical flows, this should drive oil futures prices higher during the course of this year,\" Rats wrote on Monday.\nHowever, Merrill Lynch's Blanch notes that traders have placed a record number of bets that Brent and U.S. crude prices will keep rising.

Much of that research is being done at a research facility near Detroit.\nThe initiative comes at a time when several European countries, China and California have announced plans to ban the use, sale or production of vehicles with combustion engines under the hood. In Norway, that deadline is 2025 , while in many other areas the prohibition won't come until 2040.\nHowever, the internal combustion engine will continue to propel most of the world's vehicles for the foreseeable future, Saudi Aramco CTO Ahmad Al Khowaiter told CNBC on the sidelines of the Detroit Auto Show.\n\n\"Electric vehicles have a role to play, but we believe the most effective means to bring down emissions is to actually improve the efficiency of the internal combustion engine,\" he said.\nThe number of electric vehicles grew to about 2 million in 2016, a nearly 60 percent rise from the previous year, according to the International Energy Agency.\nBut that is still just 0.2 percent of all cars on the road, and hybrid-electric vehicles, which include gas engines, accounted for about 40 percent of all electric vehicles in 2016.\nStill, fuel efficiency standards are getting tougher around the world, said Khowaiter, who believes there are many opportunities to increase the combustion engine's efficiency.\nAramco has worked with European and American automakers to advance gasoline compression ignition, a technology that allows gas-powered engines to roughly match the efficiency of diesel engines.\nAsked whether he's worried about a U.S. ban on the internal combustion energy, Khowaiter said polices that attempt to pick winners are often counterproductive.\n\"We believe policy should be technology agnostic. Let the best technology win because that usually serves the best purpose for policy,\" he said.\nSaudi Aramco is planning to take a portion of the company public in what is widely expected to be the world's biggest ever share offering.

When a team from Marriott International came to the property at the invitation of the hotel's majority owner, Trump staff asked them to leave, according to the two people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss publicly what happened behind the scenes.\nThe head of Trump Hotels, Eric Danziger, also called Marriott chief executive Arne Sorenson to complain about the visit, the two people said.\nMarriott generally steers clear of properties facing ownership and management disputes. But the call from a senior Trump executive to the CEO of Marriott, which manages more than 6,000 hotels, raised the awkward matter of how American companies interact with a business owned by the president.\nMarriott, like most major international companies, has significant business and public policy interests before the Trump administration. Federal employees who travel and hold government conferences pay to use its properties, and Marriott has been lobbying the administration and Congress over U.S. tourism, trade and legal restrictions against property ownership in Cuba, disclosures to consumers about resort fees, and other issues.\nTrump Organization general counsel Alan Garten said the call was not intended to pressure Marriott.\n\"We have a great relationship with Marriott,\" Garten said. \"They were appreciative that we let them know that we have a valid contract.\"\nA spokeswoman for Marriott declined to comment.\nThe matter highlights potential ethics concerns raised by Trump's decision not to divest himself from his businesses, said Larry Noble, head of the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington-based public interest group that studies issues of democracy.\n\"I don't know if they've got a valid contract or not,\" Noble said. \"But if you're a big company, you'd really have to think twice before getting into a fight with one of the president's companies.\"\nSince Trump took office, Trump hotels in New York and Toronto have quietly reached deals to separate themselves from Trump's brand.\nBut the Panama dispute is shaping up as a brawl.\nIn a letter to fellow owners, the investor leading the hotel owners' board of directors accused Trump Hotels of \"gross mismanagement, breaches of contract, conversion and breaches of fiduciary duties.\" Conversion is a legal term for the misuse of someone else's property for one's own gain.\n\"Our investment has no future so long as the hotel is managed by an incompetent operator whose brand has been tarnished beyond repair,\" Orestes Fintiklis, the managing partner of Miami-based Ithaca Capital Partners, wrote in the letter. Trump Hotels, he wrote, \"is refusing to maintain its last shreds of dignity and peacefully vacate our property.\"\nFintiklis did not respond to emails from the AP seeking comment.\nTrump Hotels accused Ithaca of deceiving its fellow hotel owners and illegally terminating the Trump contract.\n\"Unfortunately, it is YOU, the unit owners, who will ultimately be the ones to bear responsibility for the bad acts of Mr. Fintiklis and his cohorts,\" said Trump Hotels executive vice president Jeff Wagoner in an earlier letter to the owners last week.\nRising 70 stories in the shape of a wind-filled sail, the Trump hotel promised investors a chance to become the part owner of one of Central America's finest hotels. It has struggled to sell units after its completion in 2011. Occupancy rates are low enough that some owners receive no income from their properties and must reach into their own pockets to pay maintenance costs.\nThe effort to remove Trump hotels from managing the hybrid condo-hotel units on the property began last year, after Ithaca Capital Group purchased 202 unsold hotel units from the building's struggling developer.\nAfter buying the units in August, Ithaca and the other owners voted in November to fire Trump's directors, clearing the way for terminating Trump's contract and the $15 million arbitration claim against Trump Hotels.\nNot all the hotel unit owners were represented at the meeting, but those contacted by The Associated Press support the effort to fire Trump.\n\"They wanted to remove him quietly,\" said Al Monstavicius, a retired Nevada doctor who owns a penthouse hotel unit in the building, of Ithaca's efforts. \"That didn't work.\"\nMonstavicius said Trump's statements regarding Mexicans and his determination to strip hundreds of thousands of Central Americans of their protection from deportation have made Trump's brand toxic in Panama.\nOccupancy in recent days — considered peak high season — has ranged from 26 to 28 percent, according to Trump Hotels figures.\nOverbuilding and general weakness in the Panama hotel market have contributed to problems. Trump's team said it was proud of the hotel's financial performance. It told owners Trump's hotel has outperformed its peers for 81 of the last 84 months, but Fintiklis dismissed the claim as \"simply delusional.\"\nThe hostilities extended to Ithaca's invitation of Marriott executives to the property.\n\"We were obviously concerned about their presence there,\" Garten said, adding that he believed Marriott did not know of the circumstances.\nThe heart of Trump Hotels' claim against the hotel owners is a February 2017 agreement. When it bought 202 units, Ithaca agreed not to act \"in any manner adverse to the interests of Trump Hotels.\" In his letter, Fintiklis acknowledged the language in the agreement but said mismanagement and misconduct by Trump Hotels rendered it invalid.\nIf the owners in Panama succeed, it won't be the first time that Trump has been ousted there. In 2015, amid the early months of Trump's presidential campaign, the owners of apartments in the same building voted to fire Trump's management company over budget issues and allegations of misspent funds.\nSince then, the property's overall finances have improved. Its annual deficits, which exceeded $1 million, have since turned into a surplus, according to financial documents provided to the AP by an owner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T15:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T15:55:54.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Yet a recent survey showed the majority (59 percent) of these solo workers do not make these four-times-a-year payments. They said they do not need to (42 percent) or don't know what estimated taxes are (17 percent).\n\"If you're new to independent work or freelancing, there's no one [explaining] how to pay your taxes,\" said Alex Marlantes, co-founder and CEO of mileage-and-receipt tracker app Everlance, which conducted the survey late last year of 1,528 self-identified independent workers.\nHere's what you should know: The federal tax system is a pay-as-you-go deal, meaning you are expected to pay taxes on income as you earn it throughout the year.\nIf you don't have an employer withholding those taxes from your paycheck and sending them to the IRS and your state's tax department, the onus is on you to make those payments on a quarterly basis. (See chart below for this year's due dates.)\nYou also should be aware that just because the new tax law lowered rates on income for 2018 through 2026 and created a 20 percent deduction for qualifying earnings from self-employment, the legislation did not remove self-employment taxes.\nThis means it still doesn't take much to owe the government. If you have net earnings — your business income less expenses — of at least $400, that amount is subject to the 15.3 percent self-employment tax.\nThat levy encompasses a 12.4 percent Social Security tax and 2.9 percent Medicare tax and is applied to income up to $128,400 in 2018 (up from $127,200 in 2017). Income above that threshold is subject only to the 2.9 percent Medicare tax, with incomes above $200,000 ($250,000 for married couples filing jointly) are also hit with an additional 0.9 percent Medicare tax.\nPayment period Due date January 1 to March 31 April 17, 2018 April 1 to May 31 June 15, 2018 June 1 to August 31 September 17, 2018 September 1 to December 31 January 15, 2019 While employees of companies also are subject to these taxes, their employer pays half. A self-employed person — as both the employer and employee — pays both shares. However, half of that tax generally can be deducted, which lowers your adjusted gross income.\nAs for the 20 percent deduction on qualifying income, the new law imposes some limits. Generally speaking, to qualify for the full deduction, your taxable income must be below $157,500 if you are single or $315,000 if you are married and file a joint tax return.\nThat deduction is in addition to lower income tax rates on individuals , which you also will pay on your business income as an independent worker.\nYet even if you end up paying less in a taxes this year than you did for 2017 as a self-employed worker, don't make the mistake of thinking you don't need to pay estimated taxes. The IRS can (and will) assess penalties in certain situations. In most cases, if you owe more than $1,000 in taxes at the end of the tax year, you will owe a penalty unless:\n1) You earn less than $150,000 and pay 90 percent of your current-year tax burden or 100 percent of the previous year's tax bill; or\n2) You earn more than $150,000 and pay at least 90 percent of your current-year tax burden or 110 percent of what you paid the previous year.\nWhile the above generally holds true for all workers, employees whose taxes are withheld from their paychecks generally are less likely to underpay by enough to generate a penalty.\nshow chapters Mnuchin, taxes and the budget      4 Hours Ago | 01:16 If you do incur a penalty, the amount you'll pay depends on how much you owe the IRS and how long you've owed it. For each payment period, a penalty is applied for underpayment. The rate, which is set by the IRS and fluctuates, has been in the 4 percent neighborhood in recent quarters.\nMany self-employed workers can refer to their previous year's tax burden to gauge what they will owe in the current year. If you're new to estimated taxes, it can be trickier.\nGenerally speaking, however, you can start by subtracting your business expenses from your business income. You'll also need to know what deductions and credits you will be taking for 2018 — there aren't many left for individuals to take — and what income tax rate you will pay. (You pay that in addition to the self-employment tax).\nIf you have other sources of income — whether from a job that withholds taxes or from, say, interest or dividends — those amounts also should be part of your calculation. Remember that any tax withholdings from a paycheck count toward your total expected tax burden.\n\"You should be putting away 30 cents of every dollar that comes through the door in preparation of taxes.\" -DeDe Jones, Managing director of Innovative Financial After you arrive at a number that you need to pay throughout the year, divide it by four and make plans to mail off your payment by the due date. Estimated tax payments are done using Form 1040-ES. And don't forget your state might also want its share.\nThen, most importantly, you need to set aside some of your income so you have the money to pay those taxes.\n\"You should be putting away 30 cents of every dollar that comes through the door in preparation of taxes,\" said certified financial planner DeDe Jones, managing director of Innovative Financial in Lakewood, Colorado. \"If you never the see the money, you can trick yourself into thinking you don't have it.\"\nIf you have additional income from an employer that withholds taxes from your paycheck, you also can increase your withholdings to reflect the higher tax bill you'll pay due to self-employment.\nIt's also important to keep good records of your business expenses, Jones said. Online apps can help you keep track of receipts, mileage and other business-related costs.\nJones also recommends setting up online payments with the IRS to make your estimated tax payments easier.\nMore from Your Money Your Future: \nThat 20 percent tax break for small businesses is no free-for-all.

Trading revenue overall was down 34 percent. \nThe numbers come as Goldman looks to transition out of its long-time perch atop the trading business into other lines.

Eventually, the technology will link to shoppers' phones to help them navigate the store. \nThen, just this week it was announced that New York-based Fairway Market chose FutureProof Retail, a line-free checkout provider, to power its mobile app, which will allow shoppers to scan and pay for groceries on their phones, the company said. \nBuilding on this trend, more companies and namely grocery chains will be piloting similar technology in 2018. \nWalmart's Lori Flees, who serves as the senior vice president of the company's Store No. 8 incubator group, said the company will make a bigger push in grocery and fresh food this year, with automation and personalization in mind. \nAs options like buy online, pick up in store become more popular for grocery shopping, technology goes hand-in-hand with that, she said, and will start to roll out on a grander scale across the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T20:35:20.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

In the House, Republicans hold 239 seats, compared to 193 seats held by Democrats. \nThe poll of 1,000 people found that 54 percent chose health care as one of the two issues that that will be most important to them in deciding who to vote for in congressional elections. \nNo other issue was even close to that percentage of respondents. The second most commonly cited issue was the economy, at 29 percent, and taxes, at 28 percent. Immigration was at 18 percent, as was education. \nHart Research, which conducted the poll, found in a survey last August that health care was named by 55 percent of voters as a top issue. And in a May survey, 57 percent cited it as a top issue. \nWoodhouse said that the persistence of health care in the survey as a leading issue of concern, even after the more recent debate over the Republican tax bill, is striking, and underscores the risk of alienating voters on that issue. \nHe also noted that even after the failure to repeal the entire Obamacare law, Trump has continued to take controversial actions that involve health care, including halting key reimbursement payments to insurers , winning approval of effective repeal of the requirement that nearly all Americans have insurance or pay a fine, and making it easier for states to impose work requirements on Medicaid beneficiaries. \nThe poll found that more voters, 72 percent of respondents, disapprove of how the GOP has handled the issue of health care than do disapprove of the Republicans' job in Congress overall, which stood at 61 percent of voters. \nOnly 35 percent of voters had a favorable opinion of bills proposed by Republicans in Congress last year to repeal Obamacare, and 52 percent had an unfavorable opinion of that legislation, which all failed to pass. \nThe poll also found that there was a 10 percentage point increase in the share of voters who view Trump as actively trying to make Obamacare fail. Fifty-two percent of voters now say that, compared to the prior findings in August's survey. \nBy a margin of 55 percent to 45 percent, voters said problems with Obamacare are the result mainly of actions by Trump and Republicans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T21:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T21:51:02.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The federal government has requirements for human-driven vehicles, that don’t necessarily correspond with a vehicle driven by AI. For instance, human-driven vehicles require an airbag in a steering wheel. But if there isn’t a steering wheel in the vehicle than that requirement would be impossible to meet. GM is asking the NHTSA for permission to meet these safety requirements through a different approach. \nGM also published its 2018 self-driving safety report which contains the first images of a new generation of its autonomous vehicle, the fourth version the company has produced in the 18 months since it finalized its acquisition of startup Cruise Automation in May 2016. \nThe fourth generation vehicle has fully redundant computer systems, communication, electrical, breaking and gearing systems, Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt said Thursday on a press call. \n“What’s really special, if you look back 20 years from now at the history of AV deployment, it’s a major milestone to make a production-ready vehicle with no manual controls, especially one built on high-volume assembly lines,” Vogt said. \n“It’s quite striking,” said GM President Dan Ammann, describing the vehicle. “We believe this is a pretty notable milestone on the journey to AV deployment where we’re talking about a real production car with no manual controls.” \nGM will still have to work with states even if NHTSA approves the automaker’s petition.

The countess was the only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron.\nThe third item, a signed letter from legendary naturalist Charles Darwin to a man named Thomas Green about the publication of Darwin's research during his travels aboard the HMS Beagle, went at auction for $5,500, Gazzale said.\nAll told, tax officials recouped $134,500 from selling off the Shkreli items that they seized.\nThe Enigma machine's seizure came seven months before federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York, listed it as an asset they wanted him to forfeit in connection with his criminal conviction. The seizure came four months before Shrekli was convicted in the fraud case.\nShkreli's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, first disclosed the Enigma machine's seizure on Thursday in a letter filed in Brooklyn federal court that opposes a forfeiture request by prosecutors.\nBrafman's letter did not contain either the date of the filing or the amount obtained for the machine at auction. Nor did the lawyer's letter mention the historical documents seized by tax officials.\nBrafman, who could not be reached for comment, wrote in his filing that despite the state's auction of the Enigma machine, the 34-year-old Shkreli still owed New York state more than $450,000 in taxes.\nLandon Dowdy | CNBC The German “Enigma” coding machine used during World War II. In a filing in December, federal prosecutors in a filing said they were seeking forfeiture of Shkreli's Enigma machine, as well as of a Picasso painting, a one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album and more than $7 million in funds .\nBrafman's letter laid out his objections to the forfeiture, saying prosecutors had failed to establish \"that there are any forefeitable proceeds traceable to Mr. Shkreli's crimes of conviction.\" Those crimes include duping a group of investors in two hedge funds he ran.\nBrafman argues Shkreli \"was not indicted because he stole anyone's money.\"\nBrafman told CNBC last month: \"Our position is clear. ... None of the investors lost any money and Martin did not personally benefit from any of the counts of conviction. Accordingly, forfeiture of any assets is not an appropriate remedy.\"\nA spokesman for Brooklyn federal prosecutors declined to comment when asked about Brafman's letter, and referred questions about the auction to state tax officials.\nBrafman, in his filing, said that in the event Judge Kiyo Matsumoto orders forfeiture in the case, prosecutors \"should not be permitted to substitute assets.\" Brafman then noted the seizure and auction of the Enigma machine by state tax officials.\nThe Enigma machine's code during the war was cracked by a British team lead by Alan Turing, whose last name was used by Shkreli to name one of his companies, Turing Pharmaceuticals. Federal prosecutors are also seeking Shkreli's shares in Turing as part of their forefeiture demand.\nShkreli first gained widespread public notoriety in 2015, when Turing hiked the price of an anti-parasitic drug by more than 5,000 percent .

He also was accused, but acquitted of, swindling money from another drug company he founded, Retrophin , to repay those investors.\nShkreli, who is due to be sentenced in the case next month, currently is locked up without bail in a Brooklyn federal jail.\nHis $5 million bail was revoked in September by Matsumoto, who was outraged over his offer on Facebook of a $5,000 bounty for people who grabbed locks of hair off the head of Hillary Clinton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-12T20:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-12T20:49:49.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

An effective nuclear deterrent was also less expensive than war, it said. New weapons \nThe draft document noted that Russia and China were modernizing their nuclear arsenals, while North Korea's nuclear provocations \"threaten regional and global peace.\" \nThe draft document said the United States, while honoring all treaty commitments, would pursue development of a new nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile. It would also modify a small number of existing submarine-launched ballistic missile, or SLBM, warheads to provide a nuclear option with a lower payload. \nIn what arms control experts said appeared to be a nod to the threat of a devastating cyber attack, perhaps one that could knock down the U.S. power grid, the document also left open the possibility of nuclear retaliation in \"extreme circumstances.\" \n\"Extreme circumstances could include significant non-nuclear strategic attacks,\" it said. \nKingston Reif, director for disarmament research at the Arms Control Association advocacy group, said the draft document was a departure from long-standing U.S. policy. \n\"It expands the scenarios under which the United States might use nuclear weapons and therefore increases the risk of nuclear weapons use,\" Rief said. \nAlthough it reaffirmed an Obama-era pledge not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states if they joined and adhered to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the draft introduced a caveat. The United States reserved the right to alter that assurance, given the evolving threat from non-nuclear technologies. \nMichaela Dodge, senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, said the draft document appeared to be intentionally ambiguous about when and how the United States might retaliate, to better deter adversaries. \n\"If we are explicit about saying (when) we will not retaliate with the strongest weapons we have, we are implicitly telling our adversaries you can plan for these scenarios more freely,\" Dodge said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T06:03:56.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Washington also imposed sanctions on the head of Iran’s judiciary and others. \nRussia - one of the parties to the Iran pact alongside the United States, China, France, Britain, Germany and the European Union - called Trump’s comments “extremely negative.” \nThe ultimatum puts pressure on Europeans, key backers of the 2015 nuclear deal, to satisfy Trump, who wants the pact strengthened with a separate agreement within 120 days. \nWhile approving the waiver on U.S. sanctions related to the nuclear deal, Washington announced other sanctions against 14 Iranian entities and people, including judiciary head Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, a close ally of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. \nDescribing sanctions against Larijani as “hostile action”, Iran’s Foreign Ministry said the move “crossed all red lines of conduct in the international community and is a violation of international law and will surely be answered by a serious reaction of the Islamic Republic,” state media reported. \nIt did not specify what any retaliation might involve. \nIran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif had earlier said on Twitter that the deal was “not renegotiable” and that Trump’s move “amounts to desperate attempts to undermine a solid multilateral agreement.” \nIran says its nuclear program has only peaceful aims and says it will stick to the accord as long as others respect it. But it has said it would “shred” the deal if Washington quit. \n“LAST CHANCE” \nTrump, who has sharply criticized the deal reached in Barack Obama’s presidency, had chafed at having to once again waive sanctions on a country he sees as a threat in the Middle East. \n“Despite my strong inclination, I have not yet withdrawn the United States from the Iran nuclear deal,” Trump said in a statement, saying the options were to fix “the deal’s disastrous flaws, or the United States will withdraw.” FILE PHOTO - U.S. President Donald Trump speaks before signing a proclamation to honor Martin Luther King Jr. day in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., January 12, 2018. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts \n“This is a last chance,” Trump said, pushing for a separate agreement and saying the United States would not waive sanctions again to keep Iran in the pact without such an agreement. \nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov called Trump’s remarks ”extremely negative“, RIA state news agency reported. ”Our worst fears are being confirmed,” he said. \nThe EU said in a statement it had taken note of Trump’s decision and would assess its implications. “It’s going to be complicated to save the deal after this,” said one European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. \nBritain, France and Germany had called on Trump on Thursday to uphold the pact. Slideshow (2 Images) \nSenior U.S. administration officials told reporters Trump would work with Europeans on a follow-on deal to enshrine triggers that the Iranian government could not exceed related to ballistic missiles. \nRepublican Senator Bob Corker said “significant progress” had been made on bipartisan congressional legislation to address “flaws in the agreement without violating U.S. commitments.” CONDITIONS \nTrump laid out conditions to keep Washington in the deal. Iran must allow “immediate inspections at all sites requested by international inspectors,” he said, and “sunset” provisions imposing limits on Iran’s nuclear program must not expire. \nTrump said U.S. law must tie long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs together, making any missile testing by Iran subject to “severe sanctions.” \nThe president wants U.S. Congress to modify a law that reviews U.S. participation in the nuclear deal to include “trigger points” that, if violated, would lead to the United States reimposing its sanctions, the official said. \nThis would not entail negotiations with Iran but would be the result of talks with European allies, the official said. \nA decision to withhold a waiver would have effectively ended the deal between Iran and the other international signatories. The other parties to the agreement would have been unlikely to join the United States in reimposing sanctions. \nTwo EU diplomats said EU foreign ministers would discuss next steps at their next regular meeting on Jan. 22 in Brussels.

S&P on Thursday cut Brazil's credit rating deeper into junk territory as doubts grew   its costly pension system. \nThe move was widely expected after lawmakers last December pushed a key vote on the unpopular pension bill to February. Investors see the pension overhaul, a landmark proposal of President Michel Temer, as crucial to curtailing public debt and safeguarding long-term economic growth. Some said the downgrade could help Temer pressure lawmakers into approving the plan to avoid further damage. \"The government will certainly use this downgrade to pressure Congress, though it is still highly uncertain whether it will be successful in doing so,\" analysts at Coinvalores brokerage wrote in a client note. Equities in real estate and utilities were among the decliners on Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index while the real remained flat. The Mexican peso strengthened 1.13 percent, helped that he would be \"flexible\" on his threat to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) because Mexico faces a presidential election in July. \"Trump's statements helped the Mexican currency to cut losses and reach its best level yet in 2018.

North and South Korea held talks for the first time in two years last week and Pyongyang says it will send athletes across the border to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. \nBut the United States and others say the international community must look at ways of expanding a broad range of sanctions aimed at North Korea’s nuclear program. \n“There is growing evidence that our maximum pressure campaign is being felt in North Korea. They are feeling the strain,” said Brian Hook, the State Department’s director of policy planning. \nHook told a briefing in Washington that participants, including U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, would examine how to boost maritime security around North Korea to intercept ships trying to defy sanctions as well as “disrupting funding and disrupting resources.” \nThe 17-nation Proliferation Security Initiative, which aims to prevent the trafficking of weapons of mass destruction, on Friday said “it is imperative for us to redouble our efforts to put maximum pressure on North Korea”. \nBut North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has shown no sign of willingness to give in to U.S. demands and negotiate away a weapons program he sees as vital to his survival. \nAnother challenge in Vancouver will be the absence of China, which has significant influence in North Korea. Beijing is Pyongyang’s only ally and its chief trading partner. \nThe meeting primarily groups those nations that sent troops to the Korean war of 1950-53, when China fought alongside the North. Beijing condemned the gathering. \n“Holding this kind of meeting that doesn’t include important parties to the Korean peninsula nuclear issue actually cannot help in advancing an appropriate resolution to the issue,” foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regular briefing. \nOther invitees include Japan and South Korea, front-line U.S. allies in the Washington-led effort against North Korea. \nHook said China and Russia - which is also not attending - would be fully briefed on the conclusions. That said, Beijing’s absence will be felt, say diplomats. \n“Without China there is a real limit as to what can be achieved,” said one senior diplomatic source. \nZhao Tong, a North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing, said the United States did not want Russia and China potentially distracting the discussion by raising their proposal to halt joint U.S.-South Korean military drills that the North says are a prelude to an invasion. \nFears of war have eased somewhat after the first round of intra-Korean talks in more than two years, and Trump, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, appeared to signal more of an openness toward diplomacy after a period of exchanging insults and threats with Kim. \nBut U.S. officials say hawks in the Trump administration remain pessimistic that the North-South contacts will lead anywhere. \nEven so, debate within the U.S. administration over whether to give more active consideration to military options, such as a pre-emptive strike on a North Korean nuclear or missile site, has lost momentum ahead of February’s Olympic games, the officials said. \nFor his part, Trump has vacillated between praising and criticizing China, which he has cast as critical to reining in North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. \nThe White House on Friday welcomed news that China’s imports from North Korea plunged in December to their lowest in dollar terms since at least the start of 2014, with trade curbed by United Nations sanctions. \nLast month, however, Trump accused China of allowing oil into North Korea, which he said would prevent “a friendly solution” to the nuclear crisis. Beijing denied the charge.

One woman died and 14 others were injured. Tropical Breeze Casino Cruises didn't immediately respond to calls seeking information. Published 8 Hours Ago SHARES Pasco County Fire Rescue | AP In this photo provided by Pasco County flames engulf a boat Sunday, Jan. 14, 2018, in the Tampa Bay area. The boat ferrying patrons to a casino ship off the Florida Gulf Coast caught fire near shore Sunday afternoon, and dozens of passengers and crew safely made it to land with some jumping overboard to escape, authorities said. \nA female passenger has died hours after a casino boat caught fire off Florida's Gulf Coast, forcing her and about 50 other passengers and crew to jump into the chilly waters to escape. \nRegional Medical Center Bayonet Point spokesman Kurt Conover said Monday that the woman died late Sunday, shortly after she arrived at the hospital's emergency room at 10 p.m. He said she had apparently gone home after the fire but became ill. Her name has not been released and a cause of death has not been determined. He said eight other passengers were treated at the hospital and released. \nPort Richey police said 15 people were injured in the fire and it was originally believed that none of the injuries were life threatening. \nThe shuttle boat caught fire about 4 p.m. Sunday, quickly engulfing the boat close to shore near residential neighborhoods. \nPort Richey Police Chief Gerard DeCanio said the shuttle boat experienced engine problems after leaving the dock at Port Richey, a suburban community about 35 miles (55 kilometers) northwest of Tampa. But as the vessel turned back, flames kicked up and people began jumping overboard into shallow water, according to witness accounts. \nLarry Santangelo, 57, said he had just driven into his neighborhood when he saw smoke and fire and thought a house — possibly his own — was ablaze. But then he realized it was the boat just about 100 yards (91 meters) offshore. \nHe told the Tampa Bay Times that he then saw people wandering about confused, wet and cold, after they reached land. One woman collapsed upon reaching shore and vomited, he said. Santangelo said he took about 30 of the passengers into his garage to warm up and recover. \n\"It was so windy and they were soaking wet,\" said Santangelo. He worried that some might suffer from hypothermia. \nIt wasn't immediately clear what caused the fire, which sent a huge plume of dark black smoke wafting over sunny skies on an unusually chilly winter day in the Tampa Bay region. \n\"It looked pretty dramatic because the shuttle boat burned really fast,\" DeCanio told The Associated Press by phone. \nAnother witness told the Tampa Bay Times the shuttle boat passes regularly by his family's home, carrying patrons to and from a casino ship offshore. But he knew something was wrong when smoke cut across the sunny Florida skies and he heard shouts and screams. \n\"They didn't have much time to decide whether or not to jump,\" said Bakr Jandali, 19, who was with his family at home nearby when they heard the commotion. \"The fire was moving fast. It was a hard jump.\" \nJandali said passengers had to leap about 12 feet (3 meters) and wade through somewhat shallow water. He said passengers waded in waist-deep water before reaching land. Residents then offered them towels, socks and water to drink. \n\"All of us, my family and the neighbors, brought them towels and water,\" Jandali said. \"They were so cold.\" \nThe shuttle boat regularly carries people back and forth from the Tropical Breeze Casino Cruise, which is offshore because it can't legally operate close to land, according to authorities. They said the shuttle vessel was headed out to the casino ship at the time of the fire. \nTropical Breeze Casino Cruises didn't immediately respond late Sunday to calls by the AP seeking information. \nNews footage at the site showed survivors cloaked in blankets trying to warm themselves after getting to shore. \nAuthorities said the Coast Guard, sheriff's office, police and other agencies took part in rescue operations. \nFirst there were shouts, then screams and then black smoke billowing into sunny Florida skies as a shuttle boat used to carry patrons to a casino ship offshore rapidly became engulfed in flames. But all of the crew and dozens of passengers safely escaped by jumping overboard into chilly waters on an unusually cold winter day on the Gulf Coast. \nFire belched from the shuttle boat Sunday afternoon as it was heading out on one of its regular runs to a casino ship when the crew decided to turn around, said Port Richey Police Chief Gerard DeCanio. \nHe said the shuttle boat was close to shore near residential neighbourhoods when it experienced engine problems after leaving the dock at Port Richey, a suburban community about 35 miles (55 kilometres) northwest of Tampa. But as the vessel turned back, flames kicked up and people began jumping overboard into shallow water, according to witness accounts. \nOne woman died and 14 others were injured, a hospital spokesman said. \nLarry Santangelo, 57, said he had just driven into his neighbourhood when he saw smoke and fire and thought a house — possibly his own — was ablaze.

We saw new trucks, concepts and sedans, and then picked the ones we like most. Here's what has the most potential in 2018, and here's what doesn't. \nI'm here at the Detroit Auto Show scouring the show floor for the big winners and losers this year. There have been plenty of announcements, ranging from new sedans to pick-up trucks. Here's what I think are the most, and least, compelling of the show. Winner: Ram 1500 Mack Hogan | CNBC The Ram 1500 \nFiat Chrysler took the wraps off of an all-new version of the company's high-volume, high-profit Ram 1500 early Monday in Detroit. The truck boasts a variety of improvements over the outgoing model, including a new 48-volt mild hybrid assist. \nThe mild hybrid system allows the Ram to recapture kinetic energy during braking and use it to assist the engine during acceleration, just like the regenerative brakes in traditional hybrid cars. The electric assist not only boosts fuel economy figures by 10 percent, according to Ram, but also contributes to a 20-percent increase in towing capacity. \nLuxury trims of the Ram are also offered with a 12-inch, tablet style center display reminiscent of the ones you would find in a Tesla, but flanked by physical controls for mission-critical functions like climate controls. Loser: Chevy Silverado Mack Hogan | CNBC The Chevy Silverado 1500 \nThe 2019 Silverado is by no means a bad or even unimpressive truck; on the contrary, it's easily one of the most exciting new half-ton trucks we've seen in some time. So why's it on the losers list? What happened? \nRam happened. The Ram 1500 debuted just two days after the Silverado, but its mild hybrid system was more exciting and innovative than the Silverado's new and improved cylinder deactivation. The Ram also upstaged the Silverado in the interior department, and the exterior design is fresher. \nEven the Chevy's power tailgate, which was called \"class-exclusive,\" only held onto that distinction for two days. I'm sure the Silverado will make a great truck, but poor press conference timing and the Ram's sucker-punch means that the Silverado has to be on the loser's list for Detroit. Winner: BMW X2 Mack Hogan | CNBC The BMW X2 \nThe BMW X2 is the perfect car for 2018. People want crossovers. But more than that, they want raked-back crossovers that sacrifice a lot of the utility of a conventional SUV. And of course, people want those raked-back crossovers to be made by a luxury marque and more expensive than the traditional crossover on which the raked-coupe one is based. I truly don't know why, but cars that meet these criteria fly off of dealer lot and sell near sticker price every time. \nThe X2 checks all of those boxes and more. It looks great, it's efficient and it manages to keep enough practicality that it won't be unusable in the real world. It also shares a significant amount of its underpinnings with the X1 but is expected to cost more, so it'll drive high profits for the Bavarian brand. Loser: Mini Cooper Hardtop Mack Hogan | CNBC The Mini Cooper Hardtop \nIf the X2 is everything consumers demand in 2018, the new Mini Cooper Hardtop is everything they don't care about. It's a small car from a non-premium brand, for starters. If history is our lesson, it'll also cost more than its competitors when similarly equipped and won't come with standard features people are looking for. \nSure, it's cute and comes with LED taillights in the shape of the British flag, but I'm not sure that's enough to get people to care about Minis again. Winner: Mercedes G-Class Mack Hogan | CNBC The Mercedes G Class \nThe iconic G-Class, which survived 39 years without a full overhaul, finally got its makeover in time for the Detroit show. A few parts carry over from the old model, but it's larger and more luxurious to accommodate the truck's increasing favor among the Beverly Hills elite. \nMercedes improved a lot of things that people have hated about the G-Class without ruining the things people love. It still has off-road credo, it still sports a V8 engine and it still has the refrigerator-box shape that has defined the G-Class. But also has an improved better interior, a more refined ride and more space for passengers than its predecessor. Loser: BMW i8 coupe Mack Hogan | CNBC The BMW i8 Coupe \nBMW also rolled out the updated 2019 i8 coupe. Like the new convertible that debuted at the Los Angeles Show, the 2019 i8 coupe has increased electric range and more power on tap. It's an improvement in every way. \nIt's not enough. Mercedes was able to make small improvements because the G-Class is still posting massive sales and bringing in lots of money. The i8, on the other hand, was exciting when it first came out but the hype quickly faded. The 2019 model doesn't change enough to bring the hype back. Winner: Hyundai Veloster Mack Hogan | CNBC The Hyundai Veloster \nModern cars are so capable and high-quality across the board that consumers are focusing on style more than ever. The Veloster looks great, is offered with a high-performance model, and is priced well to court younger buyers. Loser: Kia Forte Mack Hogan | CNBC The Kia Forte \nThe Forte doesn't move the needle enough. It's a safe play and a nice looking vehicle, but in a crowded segment with less sales to go around every year, it's not exciting enough to do much good for Kia. \nIt's a safe play and a nice-looking vehicle, but in a crowded segment. If you want a small vehicle from Kia, it's hard to imagine why you'd get a Forte over something a bit more fun like the Soul. Winner: Lexus LF-1 Limitless Concept Mack Hogan | CNBC The Lexus F-1 Limitless \nLexus needs two things: more crossovers, and a truly inspirational flagship. The LF-1 is the first thing Lexus has that can solve both problems. \nUnlike BMW, which offers five crossovers with two more on the way in 2018, Lexus currently offers just two. A three-row edition of the RX is a great start, but a Range Rover-fighting two-row SUV is a fantastic choice to elevate the brand's image. Loser: Toyota Avalon Mack Hogan | CNBC The Toyota Avalon \nPeople who want a lot of space want SUVs. The 2019 Avalon is a valiant effort towards reversing trends in a shrinking segment, but the biggest advantage sedans have over SUVs is dynamics. Typically, this is not where the Avalon shines. \nFor a select group of people, the Avalon will be a great choice.

Major indexes posted gains better than 0.5 percent in afternoon trading.\nIn his note, Rosenberg wondered whether the Fed will \"remain a serial bubble blower.\" \nThe criticism is familiar: Through low interest rates and trillions of dollars in bond buying, the Fed has created a credit bubble of low-cost cash coursing through the economy and, more particularly, risk assets like stocks and corporate bonds.\nRosie Hallam | Barcroft Media | Getty Images Though the Fed has been in a slow rate-hiking pace since December 2015 — the December 2017 increase was the sixth in the current cycle — its benchmark funds rate remains targeted at just 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent.\nRosenberg said the latest run-up in stocks may be due to a market that believes the new Fed, with Powell at the helm, won't be in a hurry to raise rates. A hawkish central bank has been near the top of most Wall Street strategists' lists of what could go wrong in 2018.\n\"The elephant in the living room remains the central banks,\" Rosenberg wrote. \"The prevailing view is that balance sheet tapering will be mild and that Jerome Powell will prove to be a dove. This may well be the most important psychological driver for the market — that a new and inexperienced Fed will not take the punchbowl away in the coming year.\"\nRosenberg, however, worries about valuations promoted by a Fed policy that is misguided particularly when it comes to inflation. The Fed's targets 2 percent inflation growth as a sign of healthy and sustainable economic growth, but has failed to reach that level despite a decade of historically accommodative policy.\nWhile inflation is not showing up in the traditional indicators like personal consumption expenditures and the Consumer Price Index, Rosenberg said it is elsewhere — \"art, equities, corporate credit, real estate, cryptocurrencies, commodities, precious metals. Let me know if I have left anything out.\"\nRecent comments from investor Jeremy Grantham warning of a market \"melt-up\" or final push of cash into stocks, followed by a meltdown, caught Rosenberg's eye.\n\"So Jeremy Grantham could well be onto something in his recent blow-off thesis,\" he wrote. \"But he is also intimating that we are heading into the final bubble phase and those don't end well.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T21:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T22:02:38.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It then turned to reports that Apple will be handing over control of its iCloud data center operations in China to a local company there to comply with Chinese law. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nBut behind the scenes as CES—touted to be the world’s largest tech trade show—was in full swing with major tech announcements from all of Apple’s competitors, the company still featured prominently in the news cycle. Apple optioned rights on a new TV drama this week and a little tax quirk could net the tech giant a $4 billion cash windfall. \nHere’s a look back at Apple’s week and the good and bad that came with it: \nThis is Fortune ’s latest weekly roundup of the biggest Apple news . Here’s last week’s roundup . Apple responded to shareholders last week that called on the company to do its part in combating kids’ smartphone addictions. In a statement, Apple said that its products, including the iPhone and iPad, all come with a variety of controls to curb a child’s use of its devices. But the company also promised more controls in future software updates. Apple might not have been at CES, but its products were featured prominently. Appliance-maker Whirlpool announced at the show that more than 20 of its products, including washers, dryers, and ranges, will get Apple Watch support soon . The feature means users will be able to adjust their range temperatures and see the status on a load of laundry all from Apple’s smartwatch. The iPhone maker confirmed this week that all Chinese iCloud user data will be handed over to a local company starting on Feb. 28. The move is a response by Apple to Chinese regulatory authorities that are clamping down on foreign companies housing Chinese user data overseas. Some critics see China’s move as another way for the government to spy on its users. Apple, however, has said that user data will be encrypted. Apple has reportedly green-lit a new “epic” drama series set in a futuristic world called See . The series will likely have eight episodes in its first season and will be directed by Francis Lawrence, the well-known director of films The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and Mockingjay Parts 1 & 2. There’s no word yet on when the show might air on Apple’s streaming services. A quirk in the tax bill passed at the end of 2017 allows companies that don’t have fiscal years starting on January 1 to reduce through the end of their fiscal years the amount of foreign cash they accumulate. The less companies stockpile overseas between now and the end of their fiscal years, the less they’ll have to pay in tax on offshore cash. Stephen Shay, a tax professor at Harvard Law School, estimated that Apple could save more than $4 billion in taxes by taking advantage of the loophole. Follow last week’s speculation that he was leaving the company, Apple Music chief and music industry veteran Jimmy Iovine said this week that he’s staying on at Apple . In an interview with Variety , Iovine said that he’s “loyal to the guys at Apple.” \nOne more thing… A MacBook Air that never connected to the Internet and was kept in a safe was home to the Star Wars: The Last Jedi script , the film’s director Rian Johnson said this week . Johnson said his producer was worried he’s leave his MacBook Air at a coffee shop for anyone to steal.

Consumers continue to look to high-protein alternatives to their morning cereal, and there is an expanding coterie of options available. With upstart brands outpacing their legacy peers, deals have followed suit. \nDanone sold its organic Stonyfield yogurt to family-owned French dairy company Lactalis for $875 million last summer, in an auction that also drew the interest of Chinese dairy company Yili, Grupo Lala and Dean Foods . Lactalis earlier this month also acquired Icelandic-style yogurt brand Siggi's last for an undisclosed amount.\nNoosa Yoghurt, likewise, is working on a sales process, sources familiar with the matter tell CNBC. The company expects to generate more than $250 million in sales, the sources added. The sales process was first reported by the New York Post.\nThe sources asked not to be named because the information is confidential. Noosa declined to comment.\nDistinction in the yogurt aisle has come in many flavors. Yogurt companies are looking to cater to those looking for a snack, an indulgence or a breakfast. They also claim different origins, ranging from Icelandic to Australian. They've developed brand identities: Siggi's is the serious one, Noosa the fun one, and Stonyfield the organic one. \nSome, though, have struggled to find an identity or to innovate in a way that caters to the younger generation. Packaged food giant General Mills continues to see sales of its U.S. yogurt drop, posting a 11 percent decline last quarter, as demand for Yoplait Greek and Yoplait Light products remained weak.\nThe deal activity in the yogurt segment comes amid broader activity in the $33 billion U.S. snacking space, as food giants, which are under increasing pressure, look to reach diners that eat on the go.\nJust within the past few months, Kellogg announced its $600 million acquisition of RXBar , and Mars invested in the parent company of Kind Bar at a valuation of $3 to $4 billion. \nSome have fetched multiples more than five times revenue, sources say. Food deals last year were at record valuation multiples, according to data from Dealogic that dates back to 1995. These deals fetched an average value of 25 times enterprise value to EBITDA.\nOn a larger scale, Campbell Soup announced plans to buy snacks company Snyder's-Lance for $4.87 billion. Hershey announced plans to buy SkinnyPop's parent, Amplify, for $1.6 billion. Both are the companies' largest acquisitions to date.\nWATCH: 'Foodie generation' willing to pay for iconic food brands show chapters 'Foodie generation' willing to pay up for iconic food brands: Goldbely CEO      9:08 AM ET Wed, 27 Dec 2017 | 04:28", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-13T01:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-13T01:57:10.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Ford’s engineering, research and development expenses for 2016, the last full year available, were $7.3 billion, up from $6.7 billion in 2015. \nFord Chief Executive Jim Hackett told investors last October the automaker would slash $14 billion in costs over the next five years and shift capital investment away from sedans and internal combustion engines to develop more trucks and electric and hybrid cars. \nOf the 40 electrified vehicles Ford plans for its global lineup by 2022, 16 will be fully electric and the rest will be plug-in hybrids, executives said. \n“We’re all in on this and we’re taking our mainstream vehicles, our most iconic vehicles, and we’re electrifying them,” Ford told reporters. “If we want to be successful with electrification, we have to do it with vehicles that are already popular.” \nFor more on Ford, watch Fortune’s video: \nGeneral Motors (gm) , Toyota Motor Corp (tm) and Volkswagen AG (vlkpf) , have already outlined aggressive plans to expand their electric vehicle offerings and offer them to consumers who want luxury, performance and an SUV body style – or all three attributes in the same vehicle. \nMainstream auto makers are reacting in part to pressure from regulators in China, Europe and California to slash carbon emissions from fossil fuels. They also are under pressure from Tesla’s (tsla) success at creating electric sedans and SUVs that inspire would-be owners to line up outside showrooms and flood the company with orders. \nGM said last year it would add 20 new battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to its global lineup by 2023, financed by robust profits from those very same traditional internal combustion engine vehicles in the United States and China. \nGM Chief Executive Mary Barra has promised investors the Detroit automaker will make money selling electric cars by 2021. \nVolkswagen said in November it would spend $40 billion on electric cars, autonomous driving and new mobility services by the end of 2022 – significantly more than when it announced two months earlier it would invest more than 20 billion euros on electric and self-driving cars through 2030. \nToyota is racing to commercialize a breakthrough battery technology during the first half of the 2020s with the potential to cut the cost of making electric cars. \nFord’s president of global markets, Jim Farley, said on Sunday that Ford would bring a high-performance electric utility vehicle to market by 2020. The company will begin production of a hybrid version of its popular F-150 truck at a plant in Dearborn, Michigan, in 2020. \n“What we learned from this first cycle of electrification is people want really nice products,” Farley said. ‘Think big’ \nFord’s shift to the electric vehicle strategy has been more than six months in the making after Hackett replaced former Chief Executive Mark Fields in May. \nThe plan was finalized in recent months after an extensive review, a person familiar with the process said. In October, Ford disclosed it had formed a team to accelerate global development of electric vehicles, whose mission is to “think big” and “make quicker decisions.” \nSome of the electric vehicles will be produced with Ford’s JV in China aimed at the Chinese market. One aim of Ford’s “Team Edison” is to identify and develop electric-vehicle partnerships with other companies, including suppliers, in some markets, according to Sherif Marakby, vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification. \nChina, India, France and the United Kingdom all have announced plans to phase out vehicles powered by combustion engines and fossil fuels between 2030 and 2040.

Morris 11:06 AM EST \nResponding to President Donald Trump’s reported denigrating comments in a meeting on immigration, vacation-rental platform Airbnb says it will spend at least $100,000 on digital ads promoting listings in Haiti, El Salvador and African countries. \nAirbnb says the 75,000 hosts in those locales earned $170 million in 2017, during an expansion push there. The company says it wants to “encourage more travelers to visit these special and beautiful places,” as part of “our mission to create a world where anyone can belong anywhere.” \nFollowing Trump’s remarks, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky also highlighted several Airbnb listings on Twitter, including sites in Kenya, Ghana, and Haiti.

Both have strengthening civil institutions and saw very healthy 2017 GDP growth – 6.1% for Ghana and 5.5% for Kenya , according to the World Bank. Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, has been described as Africa’s Silicon Valley . Foreign investment is accelerating across Africa, substantially driven by China – suggesting that outdated views of Africa are leading to missed opportunities for American influence there. \nTrump’s comment, which he has denied but which were confirmed by Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, adds to a growing list of White House initiatives and stances widely seen as racist. Airbnb has cannily translated its cosmopolitan ethos into a series of headline-grabbing gestures pushing back against them. It offered free housing to those impacted by Trump’s attempted ban on travel from some Muslim countries, and ran a Super Bowl ad critical of isolationism. Airbnb later preemptively canceled the accounts of white nationalists attending a Charlottesville rally. When that rally turned deadly, Trump was slow to condemn racist demonstrators. \nAirbnb is not without its own problems, though, with both specific incidents and careful research highlighting racial discrimination by some hosts on the platform. Airbnb has adopted several initiatives and partnerships to try and remedy the problem.

The event registered as a magnitude 2.0 earthquake on the Richter scale SHARES Source: IG/@topherlaine \nA bright and loud fireball in the sky over Detroit on Tuesday night was a falling meteor. \nAt about 8:10 p.m. ET witnesses in Michigan and several surrounding states reported hearing a loud boom and a brief blazing flash in the sky, said the American Meteor Society. \nFootage from dash cams showed the blast. Tweet \nThe explosion registered as a magnitude 2.0 earthquake on the Richter Scale, U.S. Geological Survey said. Witnesses reported weak or light shaking in areas around where the explosion occurred, according to USGS data . \nThe meteor was about two yards in diameter and fell into the atmosphere at about 28,000 miles per hour, said Bill Cooke, who leads NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. \nThe flash it made is called a \"super bolide,\" a term given to fireballs that are brighter than the moon but dimmer than the sun, Cooke said. \n\"Fireballs of that magnitude are pretty rare for Michigan,\" he said, adding that only about 10 super bolides explode above the United States in a year. The fact that this happened above the populous Detroit area is one reason the story is generating so much interest, he said. \nAs it burned up, the meteor probably sloughed off a spray of smaller meteorites, which are likely lying on the ground near the site. \nIn the wake of these events, meteor hunters collect meteorite samples and send them to NASA or other institutions that have the equipment to study the rocks. \nResearchers typically run the rocks through machines that can determine what elements they contain and categorize them. \nAbout 90 percent of meteors are \"stony meteorites\" made of common rock substances such as silicates, Cooke said, but a few have higher amounts of elements such as nickel and iron. \nThey can also determine the \"cosmic ray exposure ages\" of the rocks. There are tests that tell how long the rock was in space based on its level of exposure to cosmic rays.

The reason for the shutdown, according to the customer, was because the bank could not verify the compliance of international wire transfers for cryptocurrency accounts. The move is alleged to be a response to an incident of international fraud associated with one of the bank’s clients. \nDigital currency wallet Coinbase is among the companies that use Metropolitan for wire transfers, deposits, and its Shift bitcoin debit card. \nMetropolitan has yet to provide further guidance on whether it plans to restore the service. It’s also unclear what might happen to the money that existing international clients have in the bank. Metropolitan did not return Fortune’s request for comment. \nThe bank’s abrupt decision is important for several reasons. \nFirst, Metropolitan has been growing rapidly following its November IPO, in part because of its friendly stance toward the fast-growing cryptocurrency market. Some even refer to it as “ The Bitcoin Bank .” Its move to cease crypto-related international wires has the potential to curb its rapid growth in the space. \nSecond, U.S. funds who conduct business with the bank on behalf of their international clients are currently holding investors’ money with no way to return the capital. This puts the bank and the investment firms in a precarious position. \nThird, non-U.S.-based funds who exclusively manage international investors’ money via Metropolitan Bank will potentially be forced to freeze or completely shutter operations. \nAnd finally, Metropolitan Bank’s fast-growing stock could take a significant hit while its management team is still in the post-IPO lock-up period. \nIt’s worth noting the bank’s cryptocurrency customers may have alternative banks that cater to their needs, such as Silvergate Bank or Cross River Bank. In other words, a bank diversification strategy is usually employed to reduce risk in this type of scenario. (In response to a Fortune inquiry, Coinbase said it does not comment on its banking relationships.) \nThis story is developing and Fortune will update as we learn more details.

He reportedly singled out Haiti further in his remarks, asking “Why do we need more Haitians? Take them out.” \nTrump’s slur was widely condemned by Democratic lawmakers, along with some Republican lawmakers. Many called the remarks racist including a United Nations human rights official. \nOn Friday, Trump denied the comments, tweeting that his language was “tough” but that he did not use the words attributed to him in news reports. “I never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country,” Trump added. \nHere’s what you need to know about Haiti, which is indeed impoverished, rocked by natural disasters, and a frequently beset by political upheaval. But it also has a rich culture and has played an important role in American history. Haiti’s history \nChristopher Columbus landed on the island (now called Hispaniola) in 1492, and during colonization, most of the native population was wiped out. In 1697, the western third of the island was given to the French , who prospered from the export of sugar, coffee, cacao and more. Most of the agricultural work was done by slaves brought from Western Africa, who made up the majority of the population. \nThe Haitian Revolution, a series uprisings occurring between 1791 and 1804 by both freed men and slaves, ended French colonial rule. However the legacy of poverty from slavery shapes the island even to this day. \nIn 1825 Haiti was forced to pay France an “independence debt” of 150 million gold francs, under the threat of invasion, which The Guardian notes was “ten times the fledgling black nation’s total annual revenues.” Haiti helped with the American Revolution \nNearly 500 free black men from Haiti recruited by a French admiral participated in the 1779 Siege of Savannah, fighting with colonists against British. They were known as the Chasseurs Volontaires, and they were recruited with the hope that by serving in the military they’d be recognized as citizens of the French empire, according to Ozy . The siege failed and the Chasseurs were ultimately exiled. Haiti’s troubled economy \nHaiti’s economy has lagged due to the legacy of slavery, poverty, natural disasters, corruption, U.S. occupation, and political turmoil. In 2016 Haiti’s GPD per capita was $1,800. It is the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, according to the CIA’s World Factbook , with 60% of the population living below the poverty line. Haitian immigration to the U.S. \nThere were 676,000 Haitian immigrants living in the U.S. in 2015—up from 587,000 in 2010. Around 58,000 Haitians remained in the U.S. after the 2010 earthquake through temporary protected status (TPS), a policy rescinded by the Trump administration in 2017 that required them to leave the U.S. by July 2019. \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security established the Haitian Family Reunification Parole (HFRP) in 2014. The program “will allow certain eligible Haitians with already approved family-based immigrant visa petitions an opportunity to enter the United States up to two years in advance of their visa eligibility dates,” according to the State Department . Through this, approximately 5,000 Haitians are eligible to legally immigrate to the U.S. annually. Haiti’s response to Trump’s remarks \nHaiti denounced Trump’s remarks in a statement from President Jovenel Moise’s administration. “The Haitian government condemns in the strongest terms these abhorrent and obnoxious remarks which, if proven, reflect a totally erroneous and racist view of the Haitian community and its contribution to the United States,” the statement read. Haiti’s 2010 earthquake \nTrump’s comments came just a day before the Jan. 12 anniversary of the calamitous 7.0 earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010, killing hundreds of thousands of people.

She also recalls asking network executives for $5,000 more than Dempsey, to prove a point. They refused, and she felt conflicted about remaining on the show. \n“And I could have walked away, so why didn’t I?,” she says. “It’s my show; I’m the number one.

Not only did the show’s ratings spike, but she negotiated an unprecedented deal with Rhimes and the production studio that gave her more creative control and ownership of her career. \nAfter Rhimes signed a nine-figure deal with Netflix last August, Pompeo says she told the creator, “If you’re moving on to Netflix and you want the show to go down, I’m cool with that. But if you want it to continue, I need to be incentivized.

It’s not for everyone. You have to be more interested in business than you are in acting.” \nWhile she admits that asking for what she deserves is an ability she’s honed over time, Pompeo says she hopes she can be a positive example to her daughter about the benefits of owning your career. \n“My 8-year-old daughter gets to come [to the set] and see fierce females in charge,” she says. “She’s growing up in an environment where she’s completely comfortable with power.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T22:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T23:11:26.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Morris 12:36 PM EST \nCoca-Cola last week announced a major revamp of Diet Coke, including skinny cans and a variety of new fruit flavors. Diet Coke is still a pillar of Coke’s business, but the revamp comes as it is facing dramatic headwinds – according to one analysis, Diet Coke sales were down a staggering 6% in just the last three months of 2017. \nIn part, Diet Coke has been hit by the broader, steady decline in soda consumption. According to an eye-opening new story in The Atlantic , that consumption peaked in the mid-2000s. Back then, Americans consumed, on average, a remarkable half-liter of soda per day. Those levels are down by nearly half after more than a decade of decline , and are projected to keep dropping. \nThe decline of Diet Coke, though, has been faster than that of any other Coke beverage. According to Atlantic writer Derek Thompson, part of that involves dramatically shifting perceptions of what qualifies as healthy. A decade ago, the fact that Diet Coke has no sugar or calories made it seem, for many, like a healthy choice. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nBut growing skepticism about artificial sweeteners — including evidence that they may still cause weight gain — means the most health-conscious consumers are shying away. Even the new Diet Coke flavors have invited scrutiny over the use of a newer artificial sweetener, known as Ace-K. That skepticism of all things artificial may explain why sales of full-sugar Coke are actually still growing. \nThe fate of Diet Coke, and even of soda, doesn’t entirely indicate the future of the Coca-Cola company, which has aggressively diversified into growing categories like juices, energy drinks and bottled water. Nonetheless, the hit to one of Coke’s core products may be showing — Coke’s growth was flat for much of 2017.

Its shares finished 3% higher on the news. \nAn IPO of about 2 trillion yen would be one of the biggest offerings by a Japanese company, rivaling a 2.1 trillion yen listing by NTT DoCoMo Inc in 1998 and the 2.2 trillion yen raised by the government’s sale of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp shares before its 1987 listing. \nLarge companies seeking to list in Tokyo are required to float at least 35% of their shares although these rules can be eased when the company is also listing overseas. \nCOMPLEX STRUCTURE \nSoftBank Group has a vast range of holdings including stakes in British chip designer ARM Holdings, struggling U.S. wireless service provider Sprint Corp as well as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. \nIt has with other investors also set up a $93 billion Vision Fund that is investing in a range of firms to capitalize on a tech future expected to be driven by artificial intelligence, robotics and interconnected devices. \nThat complicated structure and constant stream of new investments has made valuing the company extremely difficult and analysts often note that its market value does not accurately reflect the value of its massive holdings. \nSoftBank Group’s market capitalisation currently stands at around $92 billion. By contrast, its near 30% stake in Alibaba is worth around $140 billion. \nAn IPO could lead to softness in SoftBank Group shares for a while as some telecoms-focused investors sell their holdings to buy shares in the newly listed entity, said Chris Lane, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. \n“What SoftBank will ultimately have to do, and they would have to do this in any case, is attract investors who are looking at this as a tech focused investment co(mpany),” he said. \nThe domestic telecoms unit posted a 4.5% rise in operating profit to 720 billion yen in the year ended March on sales of 3.2 trillion yen. \nWhile it has been SoftBank Group’s most profitable source of income, it faces headwinds including an aging population, a shift by consumers to cheaper carriers and plans by e-commerce firm Rakuten Inc to enter the market. \nWith SoftBank‘s founder Masayoshi Son reluctant to sell stakes in investments seen as having large upside potential such as Alibaba, listing the telecoms business could provide a place to park some of the conglomerate’s large debt burden. \n“If the desire is to be able to raise capital for future vision funds, pushing as much of the debt into the telco as possible makes sense,” said Lane. \nSoftBank‘s debt pile stood at around $100 billion in the financial quarter ended September.

He said Coinone was cooperating with the investigation. \nBithumb, the second largest virtual currency operator in South Korea, was also raided by the tax authorities on Wednesday. \n“We were asked by the tax officials to disclose paperwork and things yesterday,” an official at Bithumb said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. \nSouth Korean financial authorities had previously said they are inspecting six local banks that offer virtual currency accounts to institutions, amid concerns the increasing use of such assets could lead to a surge in crime. \nThe crackdown on Seoul-based operators of some of the world’s busiest virtual currency exchanges comes as the government attempts to calm frenzied demand for cryptocurrency trading in Asia’s fourth largest economy. \nBitcoin’s 1,500 percent surge last year has stoked huge demand for cryptocurrency in South Korea, drawing college students to housewives and sparking concerns about a gambling addiction.

Morgan , Wells Fargo and PNC Financial reporting their quarterly numbers.\nBut CNBC's Jim Cramer knows the fourth quarter tends to be \"messier\" for financial companies, so he wanted to make sure investors were prepared for the big day.\n\"I'm not trying to predict which banks will do well and which ones won't,\" the \" Mad Money \" host said. \"I simply want to help separate the signal from the noise so that you'll be in a position to understand what's actually happening as it happens.\"\nTop concerns First, Cramer assessed the impact of the newly passed tax code . When it became clear in December that the bill would pass, major lenders like Citigroup started to incur one-time, multi-billion-dollar charges in order to offset future taxes.\n\"Big companies like the financials have tons of unrecognized losses at any given time,\" Cramer explained. \"Those losses were much more valuable in 2017, offsetting a 35 percent tax rate, than they will be this year, when they only offset a 21 percent tax rate.\"\nSo, to take full advantage of the new tax code, banks decided to take write-offs in the fourth quarter despite their adverse effects on the earnings reports.\nJ.P. Morgan, for one, risks reporting a 35 percent drop in its year-over-year net income, Reuters reported .\n\"Put it all together and that means the earnings for the fourth quarter could look horrendous on the surface,\" Cramer said. \"People will be [selling] the moment that it happens. I'm trying to steel you from that.\"\nSecond, Cramer predicted that trading volumes would be down dramatically year over year, in part because of the trading bonanza that followed Donald Trump's election in late 2016.\n\"That's pretty suboptimal, but you have to understand that the banks are coming up against some very difficult comparisons here,\" he said.\nKey metrics Next, Cramer laid out the most important ways for investors to evaluate the bank's individual performance, starting with the net interest margin.\nThe No. 1 key metric for the industry, net interest margin is the difference between what banks pay individuals for their deposits and what they charge individuals for loans.\n\"It's still the primary way that banks make their money,\" Cramer said. \"Given that we got three rate hikes last year and the last quarter the net interest margins were pretty impressive, there's some real reason for optimism here and I think it could prevail.\"\nIf net interest margins go up this quarter, the regional banks — which are purer plays on lending than the larger institutions — would benefit the most, Cramer said.\nThe second-most important metric for the banks is loan growth, also a key indicator for the health of the broader economy.\nStrong loan growth means good things for the banks and for business confidence, as companies become more willing to borrow based on improved prospects.\nBut Cramer was most excited to hear about the big banks' plans for their dividend and share buyback programs. Lower tax rates and a less strict regulatory environment have created a more favorable environment for returning capital to shareholders, he said.\nAnd with a former investment banker about to become the new Federal Reserve chairman, Cramer expected the banks to feel encouraged, if not eager, to reward their investors.\n\"They are sitting on boatloads of cash, so let's see how much they can increase their buybacks or signal large dividend boosts without risking the ire of the Fed,\" he said.\nFinal thoughts As always, Cramer said the most valuable information will come from the banks' conference calls, because managements undeniably understand their businesses better than anybody else.\n\"Here's the bottom line: when the banks start reporting tomorrow, please don't be thrown off by all the one-time charges from the fourth quarter — they will be humongous — but do listen to everything they have to say about net interest margins, about loan growth and their plans to send money back to you,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"The banks are the key leadership group in this market, and after our recent run, I don't think stocks can handle any real bank bad news. But I'm banking on the idea that we won't get much anyway.\"\nWATCH: Cramer previews big banks' earnings show chapters Cramer prepares investors for the big banks' Friday earnings reports 20 Hours Ago | 09:37 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of J.P.

Some workers will receive $1,000, but only if they've served at the company for at least 20 years. The announcement came on the heels of new tax legislation. Walmart also revealed it would be shuttering dozens of its warehouse club stores across the country. Getty Images A Wal-Mart employee pushes grocery carts at a store in Miami. \nWalmart announced on Thursday its plans to give out bonuses of up to $1,000 to some of its employees, following the passage of new tax legislation that slashes corporate tax rates. \nHowever, the amount each hourly worker receives will depend on his or her time with the company. (See a chart below for details.) \nIn total, the big-box retailer and world's largest private employer will spend $400 million in fiscal 2018 to fund the one-time pay outs. Walmart said an employee's qualification for a bonus will be determined before the end of the month, \"and payments will be paid as quickly as practical thereafter.\" \nHere's a breakdown of what employees should expect to receive: \nMore than 20 years of service: $1,000 \n15 to 19 years of service: $750 \n10 to 14 years of service: $400 \n5 to 9 years of service: $300 \n2 to 4 years of service: $250 \nLess than 2 years of service: $200 \nAlso on Thursday, Walmart revealed it would be shuttering 63 of its Sam's Club wholesale stores across the country. Some of the stores would close immediately. \nThe company said those workers impacted by the closures would still be eligible for bonuses. \nWhile many employees, customers and analysts alike were startled by the abrupt store closure news , Walmart has largely been applauded for opting to give back a portion of its tax savings to workers. \n\"Providing employees with a bonus and better wages should also help drive additional sales, and also allow the company to remain competitive in a 17-year-low unemployment rate labor market,\" Susquehana analyst Bill Dreher wrote in a note to clients. \n\"This represents less than 20% of Walmart's tax savings which we expect will be invested in merchandise price reductions , employee training, omnichannel and other technology investments as well as share repurchases,\" Dreher said.

For perspective, the National Football League said 204 million unique viewers tuned into the 2016 NFL regular season in the U.S., based on Nielsen data.\nThe esports business surged in recent years with the arrival of streaming services like Twitch capable of broadcasting players' video game exploits to thousands of viewers.\nJust like \"real\" sports, esports makes money off of investments, branding, advertising and media deals, raking in $1.5 billion in revenue last year, said SuperData. The firm expects the esports industry to hit 299 million viewers this year and top $2 billion in revenue by 2021.\nRead more:\n11 best innovative ways to make money online, and avoid the Internet job scams\nDo we really need an Alexa-powered toilet?\nBizarre 'fast radio bursts' detected from outer space\n\"It's growing at a pretty steady pace, well in to the double digits year over year, which is very healthy,\" said SuperData CEO Joost van Druenen.\nSeveral esports leagues have surfaced, luring investors from traditional sports leagues including former NBA star Rick Fox, owner of esports organization Echo Fox, and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Even the International Olympic Committee is reportedly considering adding esports to future Olympic Games .\nThe latest to launch: the Overwatch League, which kicked off its inaugural season Jan. 10 with 12 teams from cities in the U.S., China and South Korea that will compete against each other in the competitive video game Overwatch . The league will feature regular season matches from a custom-built arena in Los Angeles, leading up to playoffs and a championship event.\n\"Esports for me is just as, if not more, entertaining as regular sports,\" said Jake Duchesne, a 22-year-old fan who says his love of esports was sparked in the same way he started following the NFL, NBA and NHL — he wanted to watch \"the best of the best\" compete in the sports he enjoyed.\n\"I have a favorite team, players that I enjoy watching succeed and players that I dislike,\" said Duchesne, who is a student at Arizona State University.\nDuchesne also regularly attends events, including the Call of Duty Championship and the League of Legends League Championship series.\nHow did esports become such a thing? Here's a primer on this growing slice of the video game industry:\nWhat are esports? Esports basically turns video game playing into a sport. In some scenarios, it's on an individual level, but mostly it's through teams.\nThe games themselves are like different sports types, in some ways. For example, in esports, Call of Duty and League of Legends are equivalent to, say, football and baseball. Esports is the broader concept, while the games are the individual types of sports.\nWhat makes a game an esport? Video games with a strong competitive element fit best as an esport. For example, the Overwatch League is based on the online first-person shooter Overwatch , which features a series of competitive match types.\nFans of the games and teams will watch hours of competition, either through streaming services like Twitch or attending live events.\nWhat is at stake? For esports athletes, as for any competitor, it's about being the best of the best. Of course, the financial incentives are getting bigger, too. The International, a tournament featuring the game Dota 2 , boasts one of the biggest prize pools at $24 million, with the winning team splitting more than $10 million. Last year's League of Legends World Championship had a nearly $5 million pool. This doesn't factor in endorsements or potential sponsorships, which are expected to grow over the next several years.\nBecause of the money involved, more game publishers have entered the market, such as Activision , Electronic Arts with its sports titles Madden NFL and FIFA, and Turner Broadcasting, which launched ELeague nearly two years ago along with WME | IMG.\nWhat are some of the biggest games? League of Legends (LoL). Publisher Riot Games is the most popular title in esports, a multiplayer online battle arena game where players work together to take down their opponents' nexus housed in the center of their base. There are multiple paths to both bases, which means teams will try to strategize the best approach to their opponents' base, as well as techniques to protect their own. According to research firm SuperData, it boasts more than 100 million monthly active users. Riot runs events year round, and announced last summer it would adopt a franchise model similar to Overwatch League for its North American championship series.\nDota 2. It's similar in style of play to LoL, but run by publisher Valve Software, the same company behind the Steam games marketplace for PC players. Although its player base is smaller (more than 12 million, according to SuperData), it hands out more lucrative cash rewards. It runs The International, with a prize pool of more than $24 million during last year's tournament. There are also several third-party tournaments hosted worldwide.\nCounter-Strike: Global Offensive. In terms of longevity, the Counter-Strike series is among the top games in esports. Some of the game's match types are objective-based, where one team must complete a task and their opponent must stop them. Several third-party organizations run their own tournaments, including Major League Gaming, ELeague and ESL.\nOverwatch. Through the Overwatch League, game developer Blizzard and publisher Activision will attempt to run it like a traditional sports league, with city-based teams and ownership, regular seasons and playoff periods. It's a first-person shooter, but with a strong focus on team play, featuring tasks such as escorting a payload to a destination or protecting/attacking key points on a map.\nWhat challenges does esports face? Arguably the biggest is respectability. Some people don't see athletes. They see people playing a video game. For example, on January 9, former sportscaster Keith Olbermann criticized the sports website The Players' Tribune for \"publishing pieces by snotty rando kids playing children's games,\" after the site ran a feature on esports star Yiliang \"Doublelift\" Peng. Olbermann took some heat on Twitter for that one.\nKeith Olbermann tweet\nMeanwhile, debate still lingers over whether professional gamers should be considered athletes.\nDuchesne said pro gamers have an advantage over traditional athletes because they seem to interact more regularly with fans through streaming or social media.\n\"There's a level of closeness with esports players that I don't believe is as possible with professional traditional athletes,\" he said.\nAnother challenge: creating a broadcast experience so viewers can easily follow along, similar to when poker added glass to the tables so viewers could see what cards players held. \"That's makes it interesting and exciting because we have kind of an inside view and we know what's going on,\" said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter in an interview in 2016 .\nWhy is it a big deal?

It still trades at around a 30 percent premium compared to other countries.\nBitcoin BTC=BTSP was down more than 10 percent on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp at $13,199, after earlier dropping as low as $13,120, its weakest since Jan. 2.\nSouth Korea’s cryptocurrency-related shares were also hammered. Vidente ( 121800.KQ ) and Omnitel ( 057680.KQ ), which are stakeholders of Bithumb, skidded by the daily trading limit of 30 percent each.\nOnce enforced, South Korea’s ban “will make trading difficult here, but not impossible,” said Mun Chong-hyun, chief analyst at EST Security.\n“Keen traders, especially hackers, will find it tough to cash out their gains from virtual coin investments in Korea but they can go overseas, for example Japan,” Mun said.\nPark Nok-sun, a cryptocurrency analyst at NH Investment & Securities, said the herd behaviour in South Korea’s virtual coin market has raised concerns.\nIndeed, bitcoin's BTC=BTSP 1,500 percent surge last year has stoked huge demand for cryptocurency in South Korea, drawing college students to housewives and sparking worries of a gambling addiction.\nSlideshow (4 Images) “Some officials are pushing for stronger and stronger regulations because they only see more (investors) jumping in, not out,” Park said.\nBy Thursday afternoon, the Justice Ministry’s announcement had prompted more than 55,000 South Koreans to join a petition asking the presidential Blue House to halt the crackdown on the virtual currency, making the Blue House website intermittently unavailable due to heavy traffic, the website showed.\nREGULATORY CONUNDRUM There are more than a dozen cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, according to Korea Blockchain Industry Association.\nThe proliferation of the virtual currency and the accompanying trading frenzy have raised eyebrows among regulators globally, though many central banks have refrained from supervising cryptocurrencies themselves.\nThe news of South Korea’s proposed ban came as authorities tightened their grip on some cryptocurrency exchanges.\nThe nation’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinone and Bithumb were raided by police and tax agencies this week for alleged tax evasion. The raids follow moves by the finance ministry to identify ways to tax the market that has become as big as the nation’s small-cap Kosdaq index in terms of daily trading volume.\nSome investors appeared to have taken preemptive action.\n“I have already cashed most of mine (virtual coins) as I was aware that something was coming up in a couple of days,” said Eoh Kyung-hoon, a 23-year old investor.\nBitcoin sank on Monday after website CoinMarketCap removed prices from South Korean exchanges, because coins were trading at a premium of about 30 percent in Asia’s fourth-largest economy. That created confusion and triggered a broad selloff among investors.\nAn official at Coinone told Reuters that a few officials from the National Tax Service raided the company’s office this week. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Coinone was cooperating with the investigation.\nBithumb, the second largest virtual currency operator in South Korea, was also raided by the tax authorities on Wednesday.\n“We were asked by the tax officials to disclose paperwork,” an official at Bithumb said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.\nThe nation’s tax office and police declined to confirm whether they raided the local exchanges.\nSouth Korean financial authorities had previously said they are inspecting six local banks that offer virtual currency accounts to institutions, amid concerns the increasing use of such assets could lead to a surge in crime.\nAdditional reporting by Hyonhee Shin; Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Jacqueline Wong\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T04:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T04:21:44.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

But the latest of them was impossible to miss: The Wall Street Journal's blockbuster report revealing that then-candidate Donald Trump paid a former porn star hush money to cover up their affair .\nThe story has spawned a flurry of other reports about Trump and porn star Stormy Daniels, (real name Stephanie Clifford), complete with particularly salacious and embarrassing details for everyone involved.\nAll of this begs a two-part question: Will this story cause any real political harm to Trump, and why hasn't it really hurt him already?\nThe answer to the first part of the question is: \"No.\"\nThe answer to the second part is: \"See the answer to the first part.\"\nThere are two reasons for these answers. First, there is no alleged crime here. If Clifford had been paid off with direct campaign funds, then that would be a problem. But the Journal report says the money allegedly paid to Clifford came from the Trump Organization.\nSecond, America's left, right, and middle no longer seem all that sensitive to consensual sex \"scandals.\"\n\"The religious right in America has clearly decided to overlook Trump's personal failings and history in return for his backing on key social issues.\" Revelations of consensual extramarital affairs are hardly an Achilles heel in politics anymore. The fact that President Bill Clinton weathered the Lewinsky scandal and saw his peak approval ratings at the height of the scandal proved that beyond any doubt.\nBut what about the crucial Republican Evangelical voting base? Couldn't or shouldn't this be a killer for them?\nThere, too, the answer is \"no.\" That's because the religious right in America has clearly decided to overlook Trump's personal failings and history in return for his backing on key social issues.\nBefore anyone starts throwing the word \"hypocrisy\" around or feeling all too sure that Christian groups are ditching their supposed principles, remember what's happened to Evangelicals over just the last few years.\nThey've been called hate mongers and they face threats of financial retaliation for refusing to agree with the Supreme Court's decision to legalize gay marriage. They took enormous criticism for supporting North Carolina's now-overturned transgender bathroom law .\nAnd it's not just gay issues. Abortion and contraceptive laws are also a sore spot. Remember the Obama administration pulled out all the stops to fight the Little Sisters of the Poor as that Catholic organization sued to be exempt from providing contraceptive care to its employees under the Affordable Care Act.\nTo say that the religious right in America often feels under siege for a variety of reasons is an understatement.\nEnter Donald Trump. He was by no means the Evangelicals' favorite GOP primary candidate at the start of the 2016 election process. But he was able to win them over with his statements about abortion and the crucial release of his top choices for Supreme Court justice just as he was about to clinch the number of delegates to win the Republican nomination. Then he chose Evangelical favorite Mike Pence as his running mate. And even though he spoke out for gay rights at his convention acceptance speech in July of 2016, it was clear by then that Trump had won over the religious right.\nThis was true even though Trump was already a twice-divorced man, known for sexual promiscuity, and exhibiting a public persona that's a far cry from textbook Christian humility. It stayed true through the Access Hollywood audiotape scandal.\nOn Election Day, the Evangelical loyalty to Trump was clearer than ever. He won 81 percent of the Evangelical vote according to Gallup. That was a greater percentage of that vote than George W. Bush, John McCain, or Mitt Romney captured.\nIn return, those Evangelicals can hardly be disappointed in Trump's policies. He nominated and helped push through the confirmation of conservative judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. He's cut the guts out of Obamacare by repealing the individual coverage mandate in the tax reform law. He's rolled back contraceptive requirements for employers, and his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is now pushing for religious practices in the workplace.\nJust this week, the White House also announced it would create a new office to protect the religious rights of health care providers, including those who oppose abortions.\nQuid pro quo is in full effect when it comes to Trump and religious voters.\nIt's those religious voters who are the only ones left in America likely to really object to the president's 10-year-old affair with a porn star. Sure, this story is going to grab some nice ratings and millions of clicks. But with no key voting group flipping its support for Trump because of it, this is just another \"Storm\" that's going to pass.\nCommentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist.

The volatile digital currency hit a high of $12,045.09, up 30.9 percent from a low of $9,199.59 a day ago on CoinDesk. CoinDesk's bitcoin price index tracks prices from Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Bitfinex. Bitcoin traded about 27 percent above that low at $11,736 midday Thursday. \"Large dips of 25 percent or greater are a feature of the global, super liquid, near-instant cryptocurrency trading environment,\" Nolan Bauerle, director of research at CoinDesk, said in an email. \"There have been six such large sell-offs since the summer of 2016,\" Bauerle said. \"The pattern is familiar: Bitcoin falls, finds a bottom and consolidates at previous all-time high. Traders who seek to increase their total bitcoin holdings take a fiat position, or move to another cryptocurrency, then buy back into bitcoin. This massive, global traffic pushes prices back up.\" U.S. dollar-bitcoin trading accounted for about 40 percent of trading volume, while the Japanese yen accounted for about 29 percent, according to CryptoCompare.

It's more about the tenor and rhythm of the market than a level or moment.\nAn overshoot period riding on public enthusiasm and confidence is not the same as a bubble, or a mere short-term sugar rush. It's when a bull market most acts and feels like one — though the gains it creates often don't survive the next bear market, whenever that might come.\nStocks were probably in an overshoot for nearly three years from 1997 to early 2000, as the market doubled before collapsing back to early-1997 levels over two years. And the equity market never really got to this phase before the 2007 credit-bubble peak.\nA decent characterization of an overshoot is when stocks accelerate upward from already-high levels, as public eagerness to chase equities pushes the market up faster than the fundamentals are improving, and investors extrapolate good economic trends well into the future.\nSound like the current market moment?\n\nWe've certainly seen acceleration, with stocks up more than 4 percent in two weeks. As strong as 2017 was, it was an orderly climb taken in small steps. This year, the Dow industrials have had three 0.8 percent gains in the first nine trading sessions; it averaged fewer than one such gain per month last year.\nAnd the public wants in.\n\"Panic buying is a difficult term to define. Panic selling is easier, because everyone can see the market imploding to the downside at a rapid pace,\" said Larry McMillan of McMillan Analysis. \"When panic occurs on the upside, it is much tamer and less volatile. But what we've seen since the turn of the new year could certainly be qualified as panic buying.\"\nNew money flowed into equity mutual funds and ETFs at the sixth-highest pace on record in the latest week measured, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nStrategists at BAML have been calling for the peak of a crescendo of bullishness to arrive and say it's close but not here yet: \"Investors are unambiguously long and likely will stay so until rates go up and/or [earnings] go down. ... Peak positioning is on its way, but we expect asset prices to overshoot first,\" they told clients Friday.\nThe market's acceleration is also favoring juicier stocks, and that's raising the market's metabolism so far in 2018.\nHere are two ETFs, one tracking riskier and more cyclical \"high-beta\" stocks and the other defensive \"low-volatility\" names. Notice how high-beta lifted off versus low-vol last fall. This is helped by rising rates, stronger economic growth and aggressive risk appetites:\n\n\nThis helps explain the increased vigor of the market, with wider daily moves than last year's methodical grind. Note that the S&P 500 volatility index (VIX) is up slightly this year even with stocks climbing nearly every day. This hints that traders see the chance for a jumpier tape to come — and, eventually, the end of the longest ever streak without a 5 percent pullback. From what level that might begin is anyone's guess.\nThe \"overshoot\" dynamics are also evident in the way stocks have been rising faster than profit forecasts. Since the tax-cut law passed on Dec. 20, S&P 500 projected earnings growth for 2018 has climbed by 2 percent, atop already-healthy expectations of 11 percent gains, according to FactSet.\nThe S&P 500 itself has climbed 4 percent since Dec. 20 — doubling the penciled-in boost from lower taxes. This extends a trend of stocks getting richer even as earnings rebound:\n\nSource: FactSet \nOf course, bulls can plausibly argue that analysts are slow in updating their numbers for the tax windfall. Could be, but even here the market running ahead to price in estimate gains resembles \"overshoot\" behavior.\nStrategist Binky Chadha of Deutsche Bank, a staunch bull for some time, says, \"After strong, uninterrupted rally, much is now priced in at the market level.\" He adds: \"S&P 500 trailing multiple at 20.8x, are well above historical averages and in our reading also somewhat above levels implied by their historical drivers, partly reflecting immediate pricing in of future tax cut benefits.\"\nValuation is an atmospheric condition with big implications for future returns, but little influence on how the market acts for months or years at a time. For now, the demand for stocks even at rich prices is swamping supply.\nThe Ned Davis Research Crowd Sentiment Poll — a composite of several ways to track investor attitudes — hit an all-time high last week. A measure of upside momentum known as the relative strength index surged to heights seen only a few times since the 1990s.\nAll of this says the market is running quite hot at the moment and has stretched to a point where a rest would make sense and not much would be needed to prompt a quick air pocket.\nBut mostly these stats — combined with the broad strength among most stocks and solid credit conditions — tell us the market is in a sturdy uptrend and the first setback won't likely be a serious, or lasting, downturn.\nFor a decisive market break, the economy would have to disappoint dramatically, the Fed would need to get more aggressive or credit markets would have to sour — and perhaps create one of those \"financial accidents\" that sometimes strike an overconfident and over-extended investment community and rudely interrupt a bull market's overshoot phase.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-16T14:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-16T15:03:21.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Baker 6 Min Read \nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A wave of cyber attacks by criminals, spies and hacker activists should make these heady days for U.S. cyber security startups. \nInstead, many in the crowded market are struggling to live up to their early promise. In some cases, the security products they developed have been overtaken by advances in cyber hacking, according to industry executives and venture capitalists. In others, larger competitors have come out with similar technology and locked down customers. \n“I have never seen such a fast-growing market with so many companies on the losing side,” said David Cowan, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, a venture capital firm that has invested in the cyber security sector. \nVenture capital continues to pour into the industry, driven by the belief that there is no end in sight to cyber attacks or companies' need to protect themselves. Yet only a handful of startups have successfully sold themselves or floated in the stock market in recent years. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2mzClbR ) \nThe result is a number of these start-ups have become corporate “zombies” with little prospect of fetching a good price in an initial public offering (IPO) or becoming acquisition targets, experts said. Their early investors have been left without an easy or profitable exit. \nNot only is the technology behind cyber attacks rapidly evolving, the nature of how the corporate world uses security firms is changing. To save money and trouble, some companies have consolidated their security work, using just a few large players rather than spreading business around. \nCompanies are also diverting money to lower-cost “bug bounty” firms that contract out researchers who help identify security weaknesses. \n“Suddenly, we are in this situation where there are just too many vendors and too few can be sustained,” said Dave DeWalt, the former CEO of cyber security company FireEye Inc ( FEYE.O ). \n“You’re starting to see companies go, ‘oh my gosh, what do I do? Can I get more capital, do I have to merge?'” DeWalt said. \nMomentum Cyber, an advisory firm focused on cyber industry mergers and acquisitions, said it tracks 2,500 security companies today, almost double the number a few years ago. The firm’s co-founder, Eric McAlpine, estimates 300 cyber security startups launch every year. \nFew of these are pulling off IPOs. What’s more, big software companies have become less willing to acquire cyber security products they believe they can develop on their own. \n“The pipe dream days of selling companies at a rich price equivalent to ten times their revenue are gone,” said Tom Kellermann, chief executive of venture capital firm Strategic Cyber Ventures. \nForeScout Technologies Inc ( FSCT.O ), a provider of software that helps companies keep the devices of their employees secure, was the only U.S. cyber security company, excluding identity management providers, to go public last year. This compares to three cyber security IPOs in 2016 and four in 2015. FILE PHOTO: A man types on a computer keyboard in this illustration picture taken February 28, 2013. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/Illustration/File Photo \nForeScout raised $116 million in an IPO in October that valued the company at about $800 million, down from its $1 billion valuation in the private markets a year earlier. ForeScout’s backers, including Intel Capital and Accel Partners, had to moderate their valuation expectations for the IPO to be successful. The company is now trading at a $1.2 billion market capitalization. \nZombie capital: Cyber security venture capital funding on the rise while exits fall: tmsnrt.rs/2mzClbR HOLDING BACK \nTo be sure, many venture capital firms are sticking with the sector. Some are curbing their bets or backing smaller startups. \n“Startups that are likely to reach between $100 million and $300 million in value are still offering excellent opportunities for an exit,” said Yoav Leitersdorf, whose investment firm YL Ventures was an investor in Hexadite, a cyber security incident investigation company that announced a sale to Microsoft last June. \nSome larger startups, such as Carbon Black, have delayed their IPOs. Founded in 2002 by former U.S. government cyber security experts, Carbon Black, formerly known as Bit9, was a pioneer in developing tools that detect and respond to threats targeting corporate networks. \nWithin a few years, its market became more competitive, as rivals such as Cylance, CrowdStrike, and SentinelOne came out with similar technologies. Some larger companies, including Symantec Corp ( SYMC.O ), also developed similar products. \nCarbon Black filed confidentially for an IPO in 2016, while also exploring a sale to other companies, including IBM Corp ( IBM.N ), people familiar with the matter said. IBM did not respond to a request for comment. \nThe Boston-area company has yet to move ahead with the IPO, stranding investments from venture capital backers such as Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Sequoia Capital. Both firms declined to comment. \nA source close to Carbon Black said it is now hoping to go public this year, and that it delayed its IPO to integrate an $100 million acquisition of a company called Confer. \nCarbon Black CEO Patrick Morley, in an interview, declined to comment on plans around a possible IPO, or any merger discussions. \nBut Morley said the company has rolled out several cyber security offerings that make it more diversified than its rivals. He also predicted more consolidation in the market. \nAnother startup, Zscaler, which specializes in cloud security, hired investment banks to go public last year but has delayed its offering until at least March to focus on growing its revenue, according to sources. Zscaler declined to comment. \n“Some have compared some cyber security companies to cockroaches,” DeWalt said. “They can’t die, but they aren’t smoking hot either.” Reporting by Liana B.

Michael Nagle—Bloomberg via Getty Images By Shawn Tully 7:18 PM EST \nWhen stocks rocket to new records daily, it’s incredibly tempting to dismiss “CAPE Fear.” And the pros on Wall Street are unleashing every new age theory than can conjure to undermine its validity. The naysayers are wrong. Here’s why the CAPE—cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings ratio—should indeed instill if not terror the deepest skepticism. \nFor decades, top value investors and market brainiacs have embraced the highly-regarded CAPE index as one of the most reliable yardsticks for weighing under versus overvalued markets. CAPE fans include Rob Arnott of Research Affiliates, Jeffrey Gundlach of DoubleLine, and John Hussman of Hussman Funds. \nBut now, the bull market’s precedent shattering power and momentum has shaken the faith of one of its staunch supporters, the bubble-unmasking dean of deep value investing, Jeremy Grantham of GMO. \nIn letters to investors in mid-2017, Grantham stated that “this time, things seem very, very different,” arguing that the extremely high CAPE ratio wasn’t just a flagrant sign of prices gone wild, its signal in the past, but a reflection of sustained, unusually high rates of earnings growth driven by “increased monopoly, political, and brand power.” \nBut Vitali Kalesnik of Research Affiliates, a firm the oversees investment strategies for $300 billion in mutual funds and ETFs, rejects Grantham’s view that high valuations are here to stay, along with the growing perception that the CAPE is busted. “Grantham’s argument that monopolistic and brand power made companies extremely profitable is a good description of the past,” Kalesnik told Fortune. “ But projecting the theory into the future is very dangerous. The CAPE isn’t projecting high earning growth from here, it’s projecting what it always projects from these levels, low returns in the future.” \nAlong with Research Affiliates’ colleagues Arnott and Jim Masturzo, Kalesnik presents the pro-CAPE manifesto in an article entitled “CAPE Fear: Why the Cape Naysayers are Wrong.” Before examining his arguments, it’s important to understand the CAPE methodology. Developed by Yale economist Robert Shiller, it uses not current earnings-per-share as the denominator, but a ten-year average of inflation-adjusted EPS. Smoothing earnings eliminates spikes and valleys that can temporarily make PEs look artificially cheap (spikes or unsustainable runs) or too pricey (the financial crisis collapse). \nAs its most ardent advocates have long acknowledged, the CAPE’s role isn’t calling turning points in the market. On the contrary, it’s a tool designed to forecast future returns–what returns are likely to follow over, say, the next ten years, depending on the starting CAPE. Put simply, when the starting CAPE is extremely low, future returns can surge into the double-digits. And when today’s CAPE is highly elevated, gains over the next decade tend to be piddling, a pattern that repeats itself with remarkable consistency. \nToday, the CAPE stands at 33.2. It’s only exceeded that level twice, on the run-up to the stock market crash of 1929, and in 2000 during the tech bubble, when it roared into the mid-40s. The CAPE’s 146 year average is 16.6, but since 1990, higher valuations have taken hold, pushing the ratio to over 19. \nBut here’s the latest reason the bulls hate the CAPE. The CAPE’s been flashing excess valuation for a long time; let’s pick the month it crossed 27: August 2016. If investors had sold at a CAPE of 27, they would have missed a 28% gain over the subsequent 18 months. \nDoes that mean the CAPE is now worthless in its true role as a forecaster of future returns? Quite the contrary, says Kalesnik. He begins by acknowledging a factor that could indeed justify a higher-than-average CAPE. It’s well known that the market value of a group of stocks consists of the discounted present value to the future EPS. The discount rate is the sum of two factors, the risk-free interest rate, and and equity risk premium. The latter reflects whether investors view the future as risky or secure. “Now, we have low earnings volatility, low GDP volatility, and low interest rate volatility, so investors view things as extremely safe,” says Kalesnik. That perception of a placid, predictable, low-risk investment climate accounts in large part for the slender discount rate. \nThe second contributor is low “real” interest rates. Though its risen recently, the real yield on the ten year Treasury hovers below 1% (the 2.48% rate, minus projected inflation of at least 1.5 points), an extremely favorable number by historical standards. \nStill, to generate the kind of sustained high-single-digit to low-double-digit returns the bulls are flogging, the market would need to at least maintain its incredibly high current CAPE multiple—even true believers struggle to argue that multiples should expand—and rely a continuation of powerful EPS expansion. We’ve all heard the pitch: This is an earnings driven rally, and the best is yet to come. \nBut is it? Kalesnik cites several reasons why the “new era” of earnings is a myth. \nEARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH IS WAY OVERHYPED \nKalesnik states that although total earnings track GDP over long periods, earning-per-share trail by a wide margin. “It resembles the difference between GDP and GDP per capita, which expands a lot more slowly than total national income,” he says. Earnings are constantly being diluted by two factors. The first applies to existing public companies. These players float secondary offerings to fund new investments, and their managers regularly exercise grants of options and restricted stock that become newly-traded shares. Second, private companies “go public” via IPOs, spreading total profits in the economy, as well as earnings in individual sectors, over a larger and larger base of shares. Because of the widespread dilution, Research Affiliates reckons that since 1871, EPS has risen around 1.5% a year in real terms, lagging total earnings by around 2 points. \nGREAT EARNINGS RUNS ARE USUALLY FOLLOWED BY POOR EARNINGS PERFORMANCE \nIt’s one of the most basic rules in economics: Reversion to the mean. When a trend seems to defy economic gravity, it not only returns to normal, but frequently underperforms in the subsequent period. \nAccording to Research Affiliates’ findings, the rule reliably applies to EPS. Long periods of fast EPS growth are usually followed by extended stretches of sub-par performance. Over the period from 1871 to October of 2017, Research Affiliates found that on average, after EPS had expanded by 10% a year in real terms for a decade, it posted 0 annual increases over the following 10 years. And horrible stretches of 5% earnings declines gave way to glorious interludes of 4.5% expansion. \nFrom another perspective, it’s pretty well acknowledged by economists that total earnings (from which EPS are derived and on which they depend) can’t in the long-term outpace the overall economy. Yet earnings as a share of national income have surged to near records, hitting 9% in recent years, 50% over their pre-2008, long-term average of 6%. “It’s hard to argue ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-17T02:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-17T02:18:13.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The status does not allow for a path to citizenship. About 800,000 \"dreamers\" are in the program. \nPresident Donald Trump ended DACA in September 2017, saying he wanted lawmakers to reform the process within 6 months. A U.S. district judge in San Francisco ruled DACA must stay in place while there are pending lawsuits regarding the end of the program, but the Trump administration will appeal the decision to the Supreme Court . \nZuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page DACA recipients are in limbo while their legal status is being negotiated. Though he said he was \"optimistic\" there will be a resolution, he said there is a need fix it soon because people are \"living in fear with no ability to plan for the future.\" \n\"This is a basic question of whether our government works,\" he wrote. \"Can Congress come together and find a path forward, or will we default to forcing almost one million people out of their jobs and country?\" \nFacebook COO Sheryl Sandberg also wrote about DACA on her Facebook page on Tuesday, saying immigrants helped create the United States and make it stronger. \n\"The United States is not a cruel country,\" Sandberg wrote. \"But what we're considering doing to Dreamers is cruel. They deserve the chance to earn citizenship and legal protection to keep them safe and keep their families together. And they deserve it now.\" \nSee Zuckerberg's full post below : \nEvery day that Congress doesn't act more DACA recipients are losing their status. \nDreamers are members of our communities, and there are 800,000 living in fear with no ability to plan for the future. Teachers with DACA don't know if they'll be allowed to teach in a few months -- but somehow we expect them to take care of our children. First responders with DACA don't know if they'll get to stay here -- yet they worked around the clock to save lives after the hurricanes in Texas and Florida. \nThis is a basic question of whether our government works. Can Congress come together and find a path forward, or will we default to forcing almost one million people out of their jobs and country? \nI'm optimistic this will get solved. There's been some good bipartisan momentum on legislation recently. From my conversations with leaders in Congress, I believe they want to fix this, but we need to keep the pressure on so they know we'll hold them accountable. I've been calling members of Congress and you can help by calling your Congressman or Congresswoman too right now. \nTo learn more and get connected today, go to http://dreamers.fwd.us.

So six times it's hit large-scale sell-offs,\" Bauerle said. \"What we can see from that is often times that money goes into other cryptocurrencies.\" \nRipple, whose market capitalization of $40 billion is a strong No. 3 among the hundreds of digital currencies, was among the biggest beneficiaries in those past bitcoin plunges, he said. Bitcoin, with a market value at $171 billion, and ethereum at $84 billion are the top two digital coins. \nCoinDesk is an online media firm aimed at the digital asset and blockchain community.
